<h2>12 Summary of Observations</h2>
<p>12<br/>SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS<br/>Upon review of all available data at the time of writing this report, the following key findings can be made:<br/>•<br/>Pump and system operations immediately before the failure, did not contribute to the failure.<br/>•<br/>There is no information to suggest that applicable standards at the time were not followed. However, since<br/>the time of manufacture design standards have evolved in relation to limit states such as microcracking,<br/>prestress wire parameters, and protection from corrosive soils.<br/>•<br/>Sulphate resistant mortar was used in the manufacture of the pipe, which while meeting standards at the time,<br/>has since been found to be less resistant to chloride penetration.<br/>•<br/>Microcracking of the mortar due to internal or external stresses may have occurred, allowing for accelerated<br/>corrosion in areas with corrosive soils.<br/>•<br/>Some exhumed pipes with distress showed visible mortar cracking and delamination, while other distressed<br/>pipes had firm sound mortar. There was no evidence of sulphate attack of the mortar on any pipes.<br/>•<br/>Prestress wires on the distressed pipes with cracked and/or delaminated mortar showed longitudinal splits,<br/>lateral/transverse fractures, oblique fractures, pitting and general corrosion.<br/>•<br/>Prestress wires on the distressed pipe with sound mortar showed pitting and lateral fractures, indicating the<br/>mortar was not passivating the steel.<br/>•<br/>There does not appear to be any clear differentiating characteristics of the distress in Class 16 versus Class 20<br/>pipes.<br/>•<br/>Some prestress wires that appear good and electrically continuous, are brittle and are ready to fail. Therefore,<br/>electromagnetic inspections are likely reporting conservative pipe condition.<br/>•<br/>Failed wires in the non-ruptured pipes did not show any necking or visible cup and cone fractures to indicate<br/>that the wires experienced stresses beyond their original tensile strength. The necking observed in the<br/>ruptured pipe is therefore believed to have occurred during the rupture.<br/>•<br/>Black corrosion by-product was evident on many lateral/transverse fractures indicating potential SCC as<br/>defined by The Association for Materials Performance and Protection (AMPP).<br/>•<br/>There was no evidence of corrosion of the steel cylinder on the non-ruptured pipes, but there was on the<br/>ruptured pipe.<br/>•<br/>The locations of the distressed pipes from the electromagnetic inspection show no geographical patterns<br/>corresponding with land, structural or surface features. They are located in greenspaces, medians, residential<br/>roads, major roads and under the Bow River suggesting that live loading is not a consideration.<br/>•<br/>Stray current pickup or discharge is not believed to be driving the corrosion of the prestress wires but could<br/>be a contributing factor to corrosion of the prestress wires on pipes where the mortar has failed.<br/>•<br/>Extreme chloride concentrations are present in the soils surrounding the non-ruptured distressed pipes<br/>exposed to date. Soil samples around the ruptured pipe are not considered to be reliable.<br/>•<br/>There appears to have been a dramatic shift in chloride concentrations between The City’s 2014 soil sampling<br/>data and the most recent 2024 sampling data.<br/>•<br/>Elevated soil chloride concentrations are believed to be related to road de-icing activities using sodium<br/>chloride.<br/>•<br/>There is a strong correlation between soils with low resistivities, high chloride concentrations, and pipes with<br/>broken prestress wires.<br/>•<br/>Lab analysis shows evidence of general wire corrosion, pitting corrosion, brittle fractures and wire splitting.</p>
<p>•<br/>There is evidence of Dynamic Strain Aging of some prestress wires due to longitudinal splitting.<br/>•<br/>The prestress wires used on the Class 16 pipe shows sensitivity to Hydrogen Induced Cracking (Hydrogen<br/>Embrittlement) as defined by AMPP. The prestress wires on the Class 20 pipe do not show any sensitivity to<br/>HE.<br/>•<br/>Mortar lab tests demonstrated chloride penetration has occurred on three of the four distressed pipes<br/>exhumed to date, but did not occur on the ruptured pipe. The chloride penetration occurred on both Class 16<br/>and Class 20 pipes, but not all.<br/>•<br/>On the failed pipe (Class 16) and pipe 20220 (Class 20), there is no clear evidence of if or how chlorides or<br/>moisture may have reached the prestress wires.<br/>•<br/>The degree of pitting and corrosion on pipes with otherwise sound mortar, such as pipe 20220, supports the<br/>potential for microcracking since chloride penetration was not found.</p>
