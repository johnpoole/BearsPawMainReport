<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>1<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1<br/>Scope of Work<br/>The purpose of this report is to provide The City of Calgary (The City) with a summary of the forensic investigation<br/>into the failure of The City’s Bearspaw South Feedermain (BSFM), and distressed pipe located subsequent to the initial<br/>failure. This report will outline the findings obtained through various field, laboratory, and desktop investigations of<br/>the initial rupture and subsequent Phase 1 repairs. This report will not detail any findings of the Phase 2 repairs, as<br/>they were ongoing at the time of this report but will cover the electromagnetic inspection results of the entire<br/>Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe (AWWA C301) portion of the BSFM. Key findings of potential causes for the<br/>material failures and pipe distress will be provided, but this report is not intended to be a root cause analysis.</p>
<p>1.2<br/>Background<br/>On June 5, 2024, The City experienced a significant break on the BSFM. This feedermain is the backbone of The City’s<br/>transmission network, conveying water from the Bearspaw Water Treatment Plant (BWTP) directly into the Glenmore<br/>Pressure Zone (PZ). This is The City’s largest PZ, which feeds numerous other PZ’s, ultimately providing water service<br/>to over 90% of The City’s population, as well as Regional Customers. See Figure 1-1 on the following page.</p>
<ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul>
<p>The BSFM is 10.84 km in length and is comprised of the following segments: 1.61 km 1950 mm diameter AWWA C200 steel pipe. 5.94 km 1950 mm diameter AWWA C301 prestressed concrete cylinder pipe (PCCP). 3.29 km 1500 mm diameter AWWA C301 PCCP.</p>
<p>During the response to the initial rupture, The City performed electromagnetic inspections of the pipe 2.5 km<br/>upstream (west) and 1.7 km downstream (east) of the failed pipe. This was the maximum length of pipe that could be<br/>inspected given equipment and time limitations. These inspections revealed additional distressed pipe segments<br/>resulting in the decision to perform immediate repairs of five additional sites before returning the BSFM to service.<br/>Following return to service, The City performed further electromagnetic inspection of the BSFM, covering the full<br/>5.9 km length of 1950 mm diameter AWWA C301 and 3.3 km of 1500 mm diameter AWWA C301 pipe that forms<br/>part of the BSFM. An additional 0.5 km of 1200 mm C301 feedermain leading into the Memorial Drive Pump<br/>Station #5 was inspected as well. The steel (AWWA C200) section of BSFM was not inspected.</p>
<p>The City requested Associated Engineering (AE) to conduct a forensic investigation of the initial rupture, also<br/>considering information gathered from the proactively repaired pipes in Phase 1 which were identified through<br/>electromagnetic inspection.</p>
<p>1.3<br/>Investigation Summary<br/>AE compiled information from various sources including The City and its subconsultants to form this forensic<br/>investigation. These inputs include the following:<br/>•<br/>Field observations and measurements with pipes in-situ by AE.<br/>•<br/>Field observations and measurements by AE following pipe exhumation and hydroblasting coordinated by The<br/>City.<br/>•<br/>Stray current assessment by Corrpro (AE subconsultant).<br/>•<br/>Laboratory analysis of mortar, concrete, and steel samples by Tetra Tech, Pure Technologies (Pure), and<br/>Thurber Engineering (AE subconsultant).<br/>•<br/>Soil samples adjacent to and in close proximity to the feedermain by The City’s subcontractors and Thurber<br/>Engineering (AE subconsultant).<br/>•<br/>Desktop review of record drawings and AWWA standards.<br/>•<br/>Pure’s Finite Element Analysis.<br/>•<br/>Geo-Environmental review by AE.<br/>•<br/>Pure’s Electromagnetic Inspection results.</p>
<h2>2 Bearspaw South Feedermain</h2>
<p>2<br/>BEARSPAW SOUTH FEEDERMAIN<br/>2.1<br/>Description<br/>Construction of the 1950 mm and 1500 mm portions of the BSFM were completed in 1975. The portion of pipe that<br/>is the focus of this report is AWWA C-301 (ECP), commonly referred to as Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe (PCCP)<br/>Embedded Cylinder Type.<br/>The pipe was fabricated by Canron, which eventually became Hyprescon, then Hanson, then Forterra, and is now<br/>known as Rinker. This type of pipe contains a thin gauge steel cylinder embedded within a concrete core. The pipe is<br/>then laid horizontally and spun while prestressing wires are wound around it under stresses exceeding 150,000 psi.<br/>The wires are then coated in a mortar mix. It is primarily the prestress wire diameter (gauge) and spacing (pitch) that<br/>provide the internal pressure capacity of the pipe, while the steel cylinder acts primarily as a water barrier and not a<br/>structural element. See Figure 2-1 below.</p>

<p>Unique to this pipe is that the pressure classes, steel gauges, wire pitch, mortar and concrete core thickness, joints,<br/>and lay lengths are generally dictated by the manufacturer based on project design requirements, in accordance with<br/>AWWA design criteria. Pipe joints typically consist of bell and spigot made up of steel joint rings and rubber gaskets.<br/>These joints are then protected by mortar-based field coatings commonly referred to as diapers.</p>
<p>Catastrophic failures of C301 pipe are not unusual given the nature of its design. While non-catastrophic leaks do<br/>occur at joints, non-catastrophic leaks in the barrel section are considered rare. Catastrophic failures typically occur in<br/>the barrel section. Across North America, the primary causes for the pipe to fail catastrophically in the barrel section<br/>include:<br/>•<br/>Hydrogen embrittlement of the prestress wires, due to either stray current or the use of prestress wire with<br/>hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity.<br/>•<br/>Sulphate attack of the mortar coating, allowing corrosion of the steel wires and cylinder to occur.<br/>•<br/>Chlorides penetrating the mortar/concrete and attacking the steel wires and cylinder.<br/>•<br/>Installation damage or poor-quality installation.<br/>•<br/>Third party damage after installation.</p>
<p>2.2<br/>Design / Fabrication Details<br/>Based on The City’s record drawings, the specific details of each segment of C301 pipe forming the BSFM are as<br/>follows in Table 2-1.<br/>Table 2-1<br/>Pipe Fabrication Details<br/>From 33 Avenue &amp; 87 Street NW to 2424024VC7533<br/>(VC2) at Edworthy Park<br/>From 2424024VC7533 (VC2) at Edworthy Park to<br/>1724013VC5125<br/>(VC3) at Memorial Drive &amp; 21 Street NW<br/>•<br/>City Microfilm 413.0043.XXX<br/>•<br/>Constructed in 1975<br/>•<br/>AWWA C301 (ECP) - Prestressed Concrete Cylinder<br/>Pipe – Embedded Cylinder Type)<br/>•<br/>1981 mm (78”) Actual ID<br/>•<br/>Manufacturer – CANRON (now known as Rinker Pipe)<br/>•<br/>Joint Diameter – 2095 mm<br/>•<br/>4.88 m (16 ft) and 6.10 m (20 ft) standard lengths<br/>•<br/>Canron Pressure Class 16 and 20<br/>•<br/>Type V Sulphate Resistant Cement.<br/>•<br/>City Microfilm 413.0043.XXX<br/>•<br/>Constructed in 1975<br/>•<br/>AWWA C301-(ECP) (Prestressed Concrete Cylinder<br/>Pipe – Embedded Cylinder Type)<br/>•<br/>1524 mm (60”) Actual ID<br/>•<br/>Manufacturer – CANRON (now known as Rinker Pipe)<br/>•<br/>Joint Diameter – 1622 mm<br/>•<br/>16 ft standard lengths<br/>•<br/>Predominantly Canron Pressure Class 17, 18 and some<br/>11<br/>•<br/>Type V Sulphate Resistant Cement</p>
<p>The C301 portion of the BSFM does not have impressed current cathodic protection and was not designed with<br/>electrically continuous joints.</p>
<p>2.3<br/>Pressure Rating<br/>The 1950 mm portion of the BSFM conveys water from the Bearspaw WTP High Lift Pump Station (HLPS) at an<br/>elevation of 1083 m. Portions of the feedermain drop to as low as 1053 m based on the plan and profile record<br/>drawings. It is AE’s understanding that the maximum pump head at the HLPS is approximately 57 m (90 psi). Based on<br/>The City’s Feedermain Specifications, the conservative working pressure of the feedermain at the lowest point along<br/>the 1950 mm portion is then 869 kPa (126 psi). The design pressure (which considers a transient event) for the lowest<br/>portion of the feedermain would be 1310 kPa (190 psi) based on The City’s current standards, and 1145 kPa (166 psi)<br/>based on current AWWA C304 standard. The City’s current design pressure requirements exceed current<br/>AWWA C304 requirements which only require 40 psi surge pressure to be added to the working pressure. It is AE’s<br/>understanding that The City’s current standards for calculating pressure ratings were common practice at The City in<br/>the 1970’s.</p>
<p>The Canron fabrication drawings in The City’s records are missing a key page showing key design data, and do not<br/>state the design pressure of the various pressure classes used along the pipe. Rinker indicated they do not have the<br/>manufacturing records or design calculations of the pipe and were therefore unable to confirm the pressure ratings of<br/>the pipe used on the project. Rinker referred AE to the AWWA C304 standard to determine each individual pipe<br/>segment’s pressure rating. It is noted that C304 did not exist at the time of pipe manufacture, as the sole standard of<br/>the day was C301.</p>
<p>The 1950 mm C301 portion of the BSFM is comprised of Canron Class 16 and Class 20 pipe segments. Past versions<br/>of the manufacturer’s catalogues list the pressure classes of C301 pipe at various diameters and state the standard<br/>working pressure ratings at various depths of cover via design charts. In general, these catalogues listed C301 Class 16<br/>pipe as 1103 kPa (160 psi) working pressure at 0 m cover, and Class 20 at 1379 kPa (200 psi) working pressure at 0 m<br/>cover for various pipe diameters. These pressure ratings decreased as the depth of cover increased. AE could not<br/>source a catalogue specifically showing the 1950 mm diameter of C301 (ECP). As well, Rinker did not want to make<br/>the assumption that the pipe used for the BSFM had the same ratings.</p>
<p>The original pipe that ruptured was a Class 16 pipe. Located at Sta. 136+74 to 136+90 ft, its invert was at an elevation<br/>of approximately 1060 m. This equates to a working pressure of 800 kPa (116 psi), and a design pressure of 1200 kPa<br/>(174 psi) based on current City standards, and a design pressure of 1076 kPa (156 psi) per C304. The City’s record<br/>drawings provide evidence in numerous places that the Class 16 pipe was rated for a working pressure of at least<br/>150 psi. While unconfirmed at this diameter, as noted above, Canron Class 16 C301 pipe was typically rated for<br/>160 psi working pressure at 0 m cover.</p>
<p>Given the information available, there is no indication that the pipe’s original pressure ratings were not appropriate,<br/>given the standards at the time. This is further supported by Performance Curves generated for The City by Pure,<br/>which are discussed later in this report. This assumes the various pipe classes were installed at the appropriate<br/>locations as per the lay sheets. There are no indications based on the exhumed pipe that the various pipe classes were<br/>installed at incorrect locations, however Pure’s electromagnetic scans indicate changes were made during pipe<br/>fabrication and installation that were not captured on the record drawings.</p>
<p>2.4<br/>AWWA Standards<br/>There are currently three AWWA documents applicable to the design, manufacture, and installation of prestressed<br/>concrete cylinder pipe:<br/>•<br/>AWWA C301 Standard for Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe.<br/>•<br/>AWWA C304 Standard for Design of Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe.<br/>•<br/>AWWA M9 Design Manual for Concrete Pressure Pipe.</p>
<p>At the time this pipe was manufactured in 1974, only the C301 standard was in existence, having been first introduced<br/>in 1949. AWWA C304 was not introduced until 1992, and the M9 manual was first introduced in 1979. This is an<br/>important distinction to make as key changes were made to the design of PCCP pipe after 1979 which will be<br/>discussed further in this report.</p>
<p>The American Concrete Pressure Pipe Association (ACPPA) was established in 1949 (the same year as C301) and<br/>represents most North American PCCP manufacturers. The ACPPA generally references AWWA standards.</p>
