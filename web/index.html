<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <br/>On June 5, 2024, the Bearspaw South Feedermain (BSFM) suffered a catastrophic failure. The BSFM is the most <br/>important feedermain in The City of Calgary’s (The City) potable water transmission network, consisting of 1950 mm <br/>and 1500 mm diameter pipe, constructed in 1975. The BSFM is comprised of both Prestressed Concrete Cylinder <br/>(PCCP) type pipe, as well as carbon steel pipe; the failure was in a single 4.9 m long section of 1950 mm diameter <br/>PCCP. Immediately following the rupture, The City requested Associated Engineering (AE) to undertake a forensic <br/>investigation of the failed pipe, considering subsequent information gained during the exposure of additional pipes <br/>identified to be in distress following the initial failure. This report outlines the findings obtained through various field, <br/>laboratory, and desktop investigations undertaken by AE, The City, and The City’s subcontractors. <br/>The cause of the June 5 failure was the breakage of a sufficient number of prestress wires in a pipe segment causing a <br/>loss of pressure resisting capability in the pipe. The prestress wires are 16 gauge (approximately 4 mm diameter) <br/>wrapped under significant tension around the pipe’s outer concrete core at a pitch of approximately 10 mm. The wires <br/>are protected with a 20 mm thickness of cement mortar. Upon their exposure after the event, approximately 200 <br/>wires (based on wire spacing) were observed to have failed. It is believed a lesser number led to the initial failure, with <br/>additional wires breaking during the failure event. <br/>The forensic investigation yielded the following observations relative to the ruptured and distressed portions of pipe: <br/>•<br/>Some pipes showed visible mortar cracking and delamination upon excavation, while other pipe had intact<br/>mortar.<br/>•<br/>Soil testing along the feedermain showed significantly aggressive soils in certain areas, predominantly due to<br/>high chloride concentrations.<br/>•<br/>Laboratory testing confirmed that some distressed pipes did have chlorides penetrate the mortar, while other<br/>pipes showed no evidence of chloride penetration.<br/>•<br/>Severe pitting and corrosion of the prestress wires was present, as well as significant quantities of brittle wire<br/>failure. Laboratory testing determined that prestress wires were prone to splitting.<br/>•<br/>Evidence of Hydrogen Embrittlement and Stress Corrosion Cracking of the prestress wires was found. Both in<br/>this case appear to be due to chloride penetration of the mortar and/or microcracking.<br/>Factors believed not to have contributed: <br/>•<br/>There is no information indicating that the manufacturing standards applicable in 1975 were not followed. We<br/>note that these standards have evolved since this time, and that some of these changes may have extended<br/>the life of the pipe if they were in place in 1975.<br/>•<br/>Stray current induced corrosion does not appear to be present.<br/>•<br/>Pump operations immediately before the event at the Bearspaw Water Treatment Plant and secondary pump<br/>stations connected to the BSFM did not create an over or under pressure situation that contributed to the<br/>failure.<br/>•<br/>A transient pressure event did not occur immediately before the rupture.<br/>•<br/>Live loading subsequent to the construction in 1975 is not believed to be a contributing factor.<br/>Based on the information available to date, we believe that the ruptured pipe experienced microcracking or previous <br/>mortar damage allowing soil interaction with the prestress wires. The compromised mortar allowed Stress Corrosion <br/>Cracking and/or Hydrogen Embrittlement of the prestress wires resulting in brittle wire failures/fractures. The lack of <br/>chloride penetration and simultaneous corrosion occurring on some pipes suggests microcracking of the cement <br/>mortar coating may have occurred.<br/>Attachment 2 <br/>IP2024-1237<br/>ISC: Unrestricted</p>
