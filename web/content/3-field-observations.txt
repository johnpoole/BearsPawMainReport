FIELD OBSERVATIONS 
3.1 
June 5, 2024 Rupture 
Following work by The City crews to fully expose the ruptured pipe segment, representatives from The City (multiple 
departments), AE, Corrpro (subconsultant to AE providing corrosion assessment services), and Pure met on-site on 
June 8 and conducted an inspection of the pipe damage. Below is a summary of what was observed during the site 
visit and subsequent days after removal of the pipe: 
• 
The pipe depth of bury was approximately 2.5 m to the top of the pipe, aligning with The City standards at the 
time, but slightly deeper than indicated on the record drawings. 
• 
The cylinder tore in a crescent shape starting and ending from the longitudinal weld on the steel cylinder 
positioned just above the springline. The tear occurred below the springline. 
• 
The cylinder showed signs of thinning close to the tear. This thinning could be attributed to the corrosion or 
possibly elongation during the rupture. Water erosion of the cylinder was not visually apparent. 
• 
Every prestressed wire across the rupture (~2 m) was broken, and those still visible showed the wire break 
generally at the same orientation along the springline. Based on wire spacing, this equated to approximately 
200 broken wires. It is not possible to say which wires broke during the rupture.  
• 
Visually, the wire breaks at the time showed various modes of failure including general corrosion, lateral, and 
oblique fractures indicating brittle failures, and some fractures with necking indicating some ductile failures.  
• 
There was a noticeable deep crease in the steel cylinder. Potential causes for the crease are uncertain and 
could be from the rupture of the cylinder itself. See Figure 3-1 on the following page. 
• 
There was no visual evidence of external mortar or outer concrete core deterioration due to sulphates or 
other soil conditions.  
• 
The invert of the west joint had field applied grout missing; corrosion of the spigot ring was apparent, but not 
believed to be impacting the structural integrity of the pipe, and no indication of a leak. See Figure 3-2 on the 
following page. Due to the degree of corrosion present, it is likely that the grout diaper was missing prior to 
the failure. 
• 
Apart from the nearby presence of high voltage overhead electrical utilities, which will be discussed later, no 
other utilities appear to be a contributing factor.

Phase 1 Repairs 
AE was present during the Phase 1 repair program to replace/rehabilitate the five pipes found to be distressed during 
the electromagnetic inspections undertaken subsequent to the initial break. Please refer to Figure 3-4. Four out of the 
five pipes were removed and transported to the Bearspaw Operations Workplace Centre for examination. High 
pressure water jetting (hydroblasting) was used to remove the mortar coating to expose the prestress wire. Table 3-1 
below summarize the key findings of the exhumed pipes.

In general, the exhumed pipes provided the following observations:  
• 
No necking or cup and cone fractures at the wire breaks were evident.  
• 
Overall wire condition indicates many wires were electrically continuous while in-situ, but corroded to the 
point they broke during excavation, exhuming, or transport. This explains why the electromagnetic inspections 
would have reported fewer wire breaks than hydroblasting revealed. 
• 
Rubber gaskets were still soft and pliable despite being 50 years old. 
• 
Spigot and bell rings on all exhumed pipes were still in good shape with none to minimal corrosion. 
• 
There was no evidence of interior cracking or spalling on any pipes in areas of external damage. 
• 
There was evidence of patching on the internal mortar lining on some pipes. 
• 
No visual evidence of sulphate attack. 
• 
Wire failure modes visually appeared to be caused by transverse/lateral fractures, oblique fractures, and 
general corrosion (loss of steel). 
• 
There was no evidence of steel cylinder corrosion. 
• 
Hydroblasting of pipe 20220 demonstrated that the mortar was not passivating the wires and pitting and 
corrosion was occurring.  
 
Pitting corrosion due to chlorides can produce hydrogen, leading to Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) failures on steel 
components susceptible to HE. HE is considered a form of Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC), but SCC is not considered 
a form of HE. Generally speaking, HE is considered to be a primary cause of brittle failures if the fractures do not show 
evidence of corrosion byproduct, and the steel is not in an aggressive environment. SCC, which can result in brittle 
failures as well, is generally caused by tensile stress on steel components exposed to a corrosive environment, such as 
chlorides.

• 
Thrust block covering east joint. 
• 
Wire breaks are in 7.5 ft of exposed pipe to the west of the thrust 
block. 
• 
Sound concrete, no indication of delamination or visible cracking. 
 
The City chose to leave the pipe in place due to the thrust block, and reduce the risk of rupture with a structural 
reinforced concrete encasement designed by AE. Therefore, the pipe was not exhumed for further analysis.
