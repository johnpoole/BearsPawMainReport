LIVE LOAD ASSESSMENT 
Visual examination of the exhumed pipes in the Phase 1 repairs did not reveal signs of visual cracking consistent with 
overloading or other stresses. While microcracking due to live loads cannot be ruled out on the ruptured and exhumed 
pipe, the distribution of distressed pipes within green space, medians, and residential roads is relatively similar to those 
under major roads. Therefore, live loading subsequent to construction is not believed to be a factor, however 
microcracking due to live loads during original construction activities such as backfill, remains a possibility.
