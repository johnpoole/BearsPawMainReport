Soil Sample Assessment  
The City’s Feedermain Condition Assessment Program has established criteria for assessing the aggressiveness of soils 
as shown in Table 8-1 below. These criteria have also informed The City’s Standard Specifications and Design 
Guidelines for Feedermains to prevent deterioration of C301, C303, and mortar coated C200 pipe.

Soil samples obtained by Thurber Engineering (Thurber) were gathered at the five additional repair sites and are 
detailed in Appendix D. That information, along with soil samples obtained by The City subcontractors in 2014 and 
2024 (Appendix E) is plotted on Figures 8-1 and 8-2. The soil samples taken at the original rupture site were not 
considered reliable by AE due to the volume of water released and, therefore, were not included in this report.  
The data shows a significant number of segments with moderate to very high chloride levels and low resistivities.  
None of the samples showed any sign of aggressive sulphate levels. The data shows that areas with high chloride 
levels generally had low resistivities as expected, and therefore any steel exposed to the environment in these areas 
would be subject to accelerated corrosion and failure rates. 
 
While AWWA M9 did not exist at the time of manufacture or installation, the current edition of M9 specifically states 
that supplemental protection of C301 pipe is required in buried applications with high chloride environments. It goes 
on to specify that in areas where resistivities are below 1500 ohm-cm (common in Calgary), and water-soluble chloride 
exceeds 400 ppm (400 mg/L), one of several specific mitigation steps need to be taken in either the manufacture or 
construction of the feedermain. Based on available information, none of the mitigative steps outlined in M9 were 
applied to the feedermain, nor were they expected to be for a pipe of this vintage.

Figure 8-2 Resistivities– ohm-cm 
 
A desktop review of the soil sampling data in relation to the electromagnetic scan information shown on Figure 6-1, 
through the use of GIS software, revealed the following general observations: 
• 
Comparing the wire break data in Section 6 to the chloride and resistivity data along the entirety of the ~9 km 
of C301-ECP pipe, there is a strong correlation between level of distress, level of chlorides and soil resistivity.  
• 
There are some moderate to severe distressed pipes being reported near areas with relatively low chloride 
and low sulphates levels. Fluctuating groundwater levels can often deposit high levels of chlorides and 
sulphates on pipes in soils that have relatively low chloride or sulphate concentrations.  
• 
There are areas with high levels of chlorides that do not correlate with severe areas of pipe distress.  
• 
Soil samples showing both moderate and significant chloride levels are adjacent to pipes with moderate 
distress, even though some resistivity values are high and are therefore considered to have low corrosivity 
soil. This could indicate that these areas have fluctuating groundwater levels that deposit the chlorides on the 
pipe.

When comparing the 2024 soils sampling data to those The City proactively obtained in 2014 as part of its 
Feedermain Condition Assessment Program, there are significant observations to note: 
• 
In 2014, some areas along the feedermain exhibited moderate to severe levels of chlorides 
(i.e., 200 - 1000 mg/L), but generally not the level of chlorides seen around the recent failures or pipe repairs. 
Multiple locations where 2014 soil samples showed either negligible or moderate chlorides (~200 mg/L), 
2024 samples from the same locations show significant chloride levels in the thousands. Either very isolated 
pockets of chlorides exist, or significant soil chemistry changes in the last 10 years have occurred. The 
dramatic shift in soil chemistry between 2014 and 2024 samples may require further investigation as to the 
cause. Ongoing groundwater monitoring may assist in understanding if chlorides are migrating through the 
soils. As well, additional soil sampling may be warranted next to pipes that are in a moderate to severe state of 
distress to understand chloride levels in those locations. 
 
2014 soil samples indicated chloride levels were 1008 mg/L on 33 Avenue NW just west of 83 Street NW 
(Sample ID 2014-002). The 2024 electromagnetic inspection results show significantly distressed pipes between 17 m 
and 50 m from the sample, as shown in Figure 8-3 below.

Some locations indicated high soil resistivity and low chloride concentrations (2024FMSS-19), yet electromagnetic 
inspections indicated moderate distressed pipes within 10 m as shown in Figure 8-4.

In many areas, low resistivity soils and moderate chloride levels from both 2014 and 2024 soil samples were found 
adjacent to pipes showing moderate distress, similar to those shown in Figure 8-5.

Figure 8-6 shows that while 2024 FMSS-13 had moderate chlorides at 316 mg/L, just 15 m away, 2014-007 had 
negligible chlorides. Both of these samples were taken from areas off of the roadway in greenspace

Figure 8-7 illustrates that the 2014 soil sample (2014-009) shows chlorides at 239 mg/L. However, soil samples 22 m 
west (2024FMSS-06) and 15 m east (2024FMSS-07) on either side show chlorides at 1550 and 2270 mg/L, 
respectively. This is a significant difference. In addition to this, the pipes adjacent to these very corrosive chloride 
levels only show mild distress. It is possible that differences in groundwater movement along the feedermain may be a 
factor. Similar scenarios repeat themselves multiple times along the feedermain.

Figure 8-8 shows that the 2024 soil samples with both moderate and signiﬁcant chloride levels, and low resistivity, 
are adjacent to pipes with moderate distress.

Phase 1 repair site of Pipe 20095 as shown in Figure 8-9, had soil samples with chloride levels ranging from 257 mg/L 
(moderate) to 3070 mg/L (extreme), while soil resistivity ranged from corrosive (460 ohm-cm) to not corrosive 
(2460 ohm-cm). Significant pipe distress was evident on the pipe exhumed from this location.

Repaired Phase 1 pipes 20189, 20202, 20219 and 20220 in Figure 8-10 had soils with low resistivities (corrosive), as 
well as high to extreme levels of chlorides (as high as 8490 mg/L). There is no doubt based on this data that chlorides 
played a role in the distressed pipes that were exhumed from these locations. However, it is significant for The City to 
note that the 2014 soils samples (2014-011) indicated negligible levels (59.15 mg/L) of chlorides within 30 m of 
Pipes 20189 and 20202.

Geo-Environmental Assessment 
AE conducted a Geo-Environmental review along the feedermain which indicated a moderate to high potential for soil 
and groundwater contamination due to current or past activities. Refer to Appendix F. Specifically, road de-icing 
activities using sodium chloride is highly likely to have contributed to the elevated chloride concentrations found in 
the soil samples. While The City has confirmed that both sodium chloride (road salt) and liquid calcium chloride (brine) 
have been used as de-icers in the past, AE discovered a strong correlation between the elevated sodium and chloride 
concentrations. 
 
Furthermore, AE’s Geo-Environmental review concluded that high concentrations of chlorides in greenspaces are not 
surprising. This is because chlorides from meltwater can migrate and accumulate in these areas, due to multiple factors 
including the presence of gravel soils common in the region.
