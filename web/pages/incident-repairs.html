<h2>3 Field Observations</h2>
<p>3 <br/>FIELD OBSERVATIONS <br/>3.1 <br/>June 5, 2024 Rupture <br/>Following work by The City crews to fully expose the ruptured pipe segment, representatives from The City (multiple <br/>departments), AE, Corrpro (subconsultant to AE providing corrosion assessment services), and Pure met on-site on <br/>June 8 and conducted an inspection of the pipe damage. Below is a summary of what was observed during the site <br/>visit and subsequent days after removal of the pipe: <br/>• <br/>The pipe depth of bury was approximately 2.5 m to the top of the pipe, aligning with The City standards at the <br/>time, but slightly deeper than indicated on the record drawings. <br/>• <br/>The cylinder tore in a crescent shape starting and ending from the longitudinal weld on the steel cylinder <br/>positioned just above the springline. The tear occurred below the springline. <br/>• <br/>The cylinder showed signs of thinning close to the tear. This thinning could be attributed to the corrosion or <br/>possibly elongation during the rupture. Water erosion of the cylinder was not visually apparent. <br/>• <br/>Every prestressed wire across the rupture (~2 m) was broken, and those still visible showed the wire break <br/>generally at the same orientation along the springline. Based on wire spacing, this equated to approximately <br/>200 broken wires. It is not possible to say which wires broke during the rupture.  <br/>• <br/>Visually, the wire breaks at the time showed various modes of failure including general corrosion, lateral, and <br/>oblique fractures indicating brittle failures, and some fractures with necking indicating some ductile failures.  <br/>• <br/>There was a noticeable deep crease in the steel cylinder. Potential causes for the crease are uncertain and <br/>could be from the rupture of the cylinder itself. See Figure 3-1 on the following page. <br/>• <br/>There was no visual evidence of external mortar or outer concrete core deterioration due to sulphates or <br/>other soil conditions.  <br/>• <br/>The invert of the west joint had field applied grout missing; corrosion of the spigot ring was apparent, but not <br/>believed to be impacting the structural integrity of the pipe, and no indication of a leak. See Figure 3-2 on the <br/>following page. Due to the degree of corrosion present, it is likely that the grout diaper was missing prior to <br/>the failure. <br/>• <br/>Apart from the nearby presence of high voltage overhead electrical utilities, which will be discussed later, no <br/>other utilities appear to be a contributing factor.</p>

<p>3.2 <br/>Phase 1 Repairs <br/>AE was present during the Phase 1 repair program to replace/rehabilitate the five pipes found to be distressed during <br/>the electromagnetic inspections undertaken subsequent to the initial break. Please refer to Figure 3-4. Four out of the <br/>five pipes were removed and transported to the Bearspaw Operations Workplace Centre for examination. High <br/>pressure water jetting (hydroblasting) was used to remove the mortar coating to expose the prestress wire. Table 3-1 <br/>below summarize the key findings of the exhumed pipes.</p>

<p>In general, the exhumed pipes provided the following observations:  <br/>• <br/>No necking or cup and cone fractures at the wire breaks were evident.  <br/>• <br/>Overall wire condition indicates many wires were electrically continuous while in-situ, but corroded to the <br/>point they broke during excavation, exhuming, or transport. This explains why the electromagnetic inspections <br/>would have reported fewer wire breaks than hydroblasting revealed. <br/>• <br/>Rubber gaskets were still soft and pliable despite being 50 years old. <br/>• <br/>Spigot and bell rings on all exhumed pipes were still in good shape with none to minimal corrosion. <br/>• <br/>There was no evidence of interior cracking or spalling on any pipes in areas of external damage. <br/>• <br/>There was evidence of patching on the internal mortar lining on some pipes. <br/>• <br/>No visual evidence of sulphate attack. <br/>• <br/>Wire failure modes visually appeared to be caused by transverse/lateral fractures, oblique fractures, and <br/>general corrosion (loss of steel). <br/>• <br/>There was no evidence of steel cylinder corrosion. <br/>• <br/>Hydroblasting of pipe 20220 demonstrated that the mortar was not passivating the wires and pitting and <br/>corrosion was occurring.</p>
<p>Pitting corrosion due to chlorides can produce hydrogen, leading to Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) failures on steel <br/>components susceptible to HE. HE is considered a form of Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC), but SCC is not considered <br/>a form of HE. Generally speaking, HE is considered to be a primary cause of brittle failures if the fractures do not show <br/>evidence of corrosion byproduct, and the steel is not in an aggressive environment. SCC, which can result in brittle <br/>failures as well, is generally caused by tensile stress on steel components exposed to a corrosive environment, such as <br/>chlorides.</p>
