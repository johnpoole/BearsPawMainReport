<h2>13 Probable Cause</h2>
<p>13 <br/>PROBABLE CAUSE <br/>Based on the information available to AE to date, the following conclusions can be made as to the probable cause of <br/>the distress in the exhumed and ruptured pipe:</p>
<p>• <br/>The June 5, 2024 rupture was caused by the loss of structural integrity of the pipe, primarily through the <br/>failure of the prestress wires.  <br/>• <br/>Since the ruptured pipe showed no evidence of chloride penetration within the mortar, it is believed that <br/>microcracking or previous mortar damage allowed moisture and corrosive soils to interact with the <br/>prestress wires, leading to Stress Corrosion Cracking or Hydrogen Embrittlement of the prestress wires <br/>resulting in brittle wire failures.  <br/>• <br/>It is difficult to distinguish between SCC and HE, however, both can occur on the same prestress wire. HE <br/>is considered a form of SCC, but SCC is not considered a form of HE. <br/>• <br/>It is not possible to say with certainty at this point how passivation properties of the mortar coating on <br/>the prestress wires were compromised.  <br/>• <br/>Where mortar had already failed due to wire distress or other damage, the possibility for stray currents to <br/>contribute to HE cannot be ruled out. <br/>• <br/>Since Class 20 pipe was not susceptible to HE, then SCC may be playing the largest role in causing the distress <br/>on those pipes along the feedermain. The SCC would be due to the combination of tensile stress on wires <br/>exposed to a corrosive environment via microcracking and/or chloride penetration of the mortar. <br/>• <br/>Dynamic Strain Aging is likely to have contributed to SCC on some wires due to crevice corrosion on pipes <br/>where chlorides have penetrated the mortar and/or where microcracking has occurred. <br/>• <br/>Chloride induced corrosion and resulting pitting are also likely to have contributed to the SCC of wires on <br/>some pipes. <br/>• <br/>In the pipes where HE is believed to have occurred, it is believed that pitting corrosion from chloride ingress <br/>(through microcracks or mortar penetration) produced hydrogen, leading to HE and ultimately brittle failures <br/>of the wires. HE is most likely to have occurred on the brittle failures where no evidence of corrosion product <br/>is visible on the fracture surface itself. <br/>• <br/>Microcracking of the mortar over the years may have contributed to prestress wire corrosion.  The design of <br/>C301 pipe is complex, and design standards of AWWA C301 have evolved over time. The design of the pipe <br/>in the 1970’s, while acceptable at the time, may not have been sufficient to prevent microcracking, leading to <br/>accelerated corrosion from aggressive environmental conditions over the entire life of the pipe. <br/>• <br/>High concentrations of chlorides in the soil are not always required to cause pipe distress if there is a <br/>fluctuating water table, as fluctuating water tables can deposit chlorides on to the mortar leading to higher <br/>concentrations on the mortar itself. Ground water monitoring has commenced to help with this assessment. <br/>Additional soil sampling may be warranted next to pipes that are in a moderate to severe state of distress, to <br/>assist in validating probable cause. <br/>Attachment 2 <br/>IP2024-1237<br/>ISC: Unrestricted</p>
<p>• <br/>The dramatic shift in soil chemistry between 2014 and 2024 samples requires further investigation to develop <br/>an opinion as to potential causes. In addition to ground water monitoring and additional soil sampling, a review <br/>of distribution pipe failure rates in the Bowness/Montgomery area may be helpful. If chloride levels in the soil <br/>have either increased or become widespread, the corrosion and break rates of other metallic pipe in the area <br/>would also be expected to follow suit. Further to this, it would be prudent for The City to resample the soil in <br/>areas along all feedermains where chloride levels were previously found to be greater than 100 mg/L, <br/>particularly in areas along or adjacent to major roadways (Priority 1 snow removal routes). As a result, The City <br/>may wish to revisit the risk profile of mortar coated steel, C301 and C303 along pipes with greater than <br/>100 mg/L chlorides. <br/>• <br/>Spalling mortar appears to be attributed to either: <br/>• <br/>Brittle wire failures relieving tension and cracking the mortar leading to corrosion and further cracking. <br/>• <br/>Microcracking due to extreme internal or external stresses, leading to corrosion and visible cracking. <br/>• <br/>Based on the information available to date, it is most likely that the majority of the pipe distress along the <br/>BSFM is due to SCC and HE. However, it is difficult to draw the conclusion that all the distressed pipes <br/>reported by Pure along the entire feedermain have prestress wires failing due to a combination of HE or SCC <br/>without further soil sampling, pipe exposure, and lab analysis of mortar and steel components.</p>
