<h2>4 Pump Operations Summary</h2>
<p>4 <br/>PUMP OPERATIONS SUMMARY <br/>AE conducted a pump operations review immediately following the rupture of the BSFM; the technical memorandum <br/>is included in Appendix A. This review included an examination of pump operations prior to the failure, as well as a <br/>hydraulic analysis of the BSFM during a simulated transient pressure event. According to this review, pump operations <br/>immediately before the failure did not contribute to the failure. The modeled pressures during the simulated transient <br/>event were within bounds and not a contributing factor.</p>

<h2>5 Finite Element Analysis & Limit State Design</h2>
<p>5 <br/>FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS &amp; LIMIT STATE DESIGN <br/>Pure was enlisted by The City to develop Performance Curves through Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to determine <br/>when a pipe will reach various limit states as defined by AWWA C304, based on internal pressure, depth of cover, and <br/>the number of wire breaks per pipe segment. The Performance Curves for the Class 16 pipe at two depths of cover <br/>are provided in Figures 5-1 and 5-2. At the time of writing this report, AE had not received Performance Curves for <br/>the Class 20 pipe.</p>
<p>Pure’s Performance Curves for the Class 16 1950 mm pipe show that the normal working pressure and design <br/>pressure (accounting for potential transients/surge) are well within the yield strength and ultimate strength of the <br/>pipe. However, the Performance Curves show that Class 16 pipes could possibly experience microcracking of the <br/>external mortar due to mild transient events, especially in areas with deep cover (significant external loading) or if any <br/>prestress wires have already been compromised. Microcracks are very small cracks within the mortar that are invisible <br/>to the naked eye, and an indication that the pipe has experienced significant internal or external stresses.</p>
<p>Microcracking has no immediate impact on the structural integrity of a pipe but compromises the ability of the mortar <br/>to protect the prestressed wires from moisture and interaction with the soil around the pipe. There is a possibility that <br/>surge pressures resulted in microcracking of some pipes due to operations over the last 50 years. While Performance <br/>Curves for Class 20 pipes and 1500 mm pipes have not been provided, it is possible that the working pressures and <br/>external loading in those areas, combined with transient events, resulted in microcracking of those pipes as well.</p>
<p>AWWA C304, which requires pipes to be designed according to the limit states as shown in Pure’s Performance <br/>Curves, was introduced in 1992. AWWA C304 introduced a unified design procedure that replaced two procedures <br/>previously outlined in AWWA C301-84. Therefore, it is possible that the design of the pipe did not account for <br/>microcracking while still meeting applicable standards at that time.</p>

<h2>6 Electromagnetic Inspection Results</h2>
<p>6 <br/>ELECTROMAGNETIC INSPECTION RESULTS <br/>Following the June 5 rupture, The City contracted Pure to inspect the C301 portion of the BSFM west of the <br/>Shaganappi Pump Station, using robotic and free-swimming electromagnetic inspection tools that employ remote field <br/>eddy current transducer coupling technology (RFEC/TC). These inspections revealed a total of 239 distressed pipes in <br/>addition to the pipe that ruptured. See Appendix B and Table 6-1. Distressed pipes are considered to be pipe lengths <br/>having one or more wraps of prestressed wires that have broken, with each failed wrap commonly referred to as a <br/>wire break. This translates to approximately 12.5% of the 9.6 km of inspected pipe being in some form of distress. The <br/>locations of these pipes are mapped in Figure 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 and 6-4 and will be discussed in greater detail in the <br/>following sections. The wire breaks on these figures are colour coded to align with The City’s pre-existing wire break <br/>thresholds informed by Pure’s Performance Curves in Figures 5-1 and 5-2.</p>

<h2>7 Stray Current Assessment</h2>
<p>7 <br/>STRAY CURRENT ASSESSMENT <br/>Corrpro was retained by AE to conduct tests for stray current and the presence of cathodic protection on the pipeline <br/>at the initial rupture location, as well as the subsequent Phase 1 repair sites. Their report is included in Appendix C <br/>with key findings as follows:  <br/>• <br/>Corrpro conducted pipe to soil DC potential measurements that confirmed no cathodic protection exists on <br/>the pipeline as per City records.  <br/>• <br/>The DC potential was -302 mV, less than the -1000 mV industry threshold of causing hydrogen <br/>embrittlement. <br/>• <br/>No significant levels of stray current were found. <br/>• <br/>Low AC potential indicate unlikely AC influence being a factor. <br/>• <br/>Corrpro noted that while the voltage potential itself would not likely be a concern, damaged mortar coating <br/>could be a contributing factor to steel corrosion, and stray current pickup or discharge in those areas cannot <br/>be ruled out.</p>

<h2>8 Environmental Investigation</h2>
<p>8 <br/>ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATION <br/>8.1 <br/>Soil Sample Assessment  <br/>The City’s Feedermain Condition Assessment Program has established criteria for assessing the aggressiveness of soils <br/>as shown in Table 8-1 below. These criteria have also informed The City’s Standard Specifications and Design <br/>Guidelines for Feedermains to prevent deterioration of C301, C303, and mortar coated C200 pipe.</p>
<p>Table 8-1 <br/>City of Calgary Feedermain Soil Assessment Thresholds <br/>pH <br/>Aggressive <br/>pH &lt; 5.5 (Acidic) <br/>Resistivity (Lab) <br/>Very Corrosive <br/>&lt; 500 ohm-cm <br/>Corrosive <br/>&lt; 1000 ohm-cm <br/>Moderately Corrosive <br/>&lt; 1500 ohm-cm <br/>Chlorides <br/>Corrosive <br/>&gt; 700 mg/L <br/>Moderately Corrosive <br/>&gt; 70 mg/L <br/>Sulphate <br/>Aggressive <br/>&gt; 2000 mg/L <br/>Moderately Aggressive <br/>&gt; 1000 mg/L</p>
<p>Soil samples obtained by Thurber Engineering (Thurber) were gathered at the five additional repair sites and are <br/>detailed in Appendix D. That information, along with soil samples obtained by The City subcontractors in 2014 and <br/>2024 (Appendix E) is plotted on Figures 8-1 and 8-2. The soil samples taken at the original rupture site were not <br/>considered reliable by AE due to the volume of water released and, therefore, were not included in this report.  <br/>The data shows a significant number of segments with moderate to very high chloride levels and low resistivities.  <br/>None of the samples showed any sign of aggressive sulphate levels. The data shows that areas with high chloride <br/>levels generally had low resistivities as expected, and therefore any steel exposed to the environment in these areas <br/>would be subject to accelerated corrosion and failure rates.</p>
<p>While AWWA M9 did not exist at the time of manufacture or installation, the current edition of M9 specifically states <br/>that supplemental protection of C301 pipe is required in buried applications with high chloride environments. It goes <br/>on to specify that in areas where resistivities are below 1500 ohm-cm (common in Calgary), and water-soluble chloride <br/>exceeds 400 ppm (400 mg/L), one of several specific mitigation steps need to be taken in either the manufacture or <br/>construction of the feedermain. Based on available information, none of the mitigative steps outlined in M9 were <br/>applied to the feedermain, nor were they expected to be for a pipe of this vintage.</p>

<p>Figure 8-2 Resistivities– ohm-cm</p>
<p>A desktop review of the soil sampling data in relation to the electromagnetic scan information shown on Figure 6-1, <br/>through the use of GIS software, revealed the following general observations: <br/>• <br/>Comparing the wire break data in Section 6 to the chloride and resistivity data along the entirety of the ~9 km <br/>of C301-ECP pipe, there is a strong correlation between level of distress, level of chlorides and soil resistivity.  <br/>• <br/>There are some moderate to severe distressed pipes being reported near areas with relatively low chloride <br/>and low sulphates levels. Fluctuating groundwater levels can often deposit high levels of chlorides and <br/>sulphates on pipes in soils that have relatively low chloride or sulphate concentrations.  <br/>• <br/>There are areas with high levels of chlorides that do not correlate with severe areas of pipe distress.  <br/>• <br/>Soil samples showing both moderate and significant chloride levels are adjacent to pipes with moderate <br/>distress, even though some resistivity values are high and are therefore considered to have low corrosivity <br/>soil. This could indicate that these areas have fluctuating groundwater levels that deposit the chlorides on the <br/>pipe.</p>
<p>Resistivity Legend: <br/>     &lt;500 ohm-cm <br/>     500 – 1000 ohm-cm <br/>     1000 – 1500 ohm-cm <br/>     &gt;1500 ohm-cm <br/>Attachment 2 <br/>IP2024-1237<br/>ISC: Unrestricted</p>
<p>When comparing the 2024 soils sampling data to those The City proactively obtained in 2014 as part of its <br/>Feedermain Condition Assessment Program, there are significant observations to note: <br/>• <br/>In 2014, some areas along the feedermain exhibited moderate to severe levels of chlorides <br/>(i.e., 200 - 1000 mg/L), but generally not the level of chlorides seen around the recent failures or pipe repairs. <br/>Multiple locations where 2014 soil samples showed either negligible or moderate chlorides (~200 mg/L), <br/>2024 samples from the same locations show significant chloride levels in the thousands. Either very isolated <br/>pockets of chlorides exist, or significant soil chemistry changes in the last 10 years have occurred. The <br/>dramatic shift in soil chemistry between 2014 and 2024 samples may require further investigation as to the <br/>cause. Ongoing groundwater monitoring may assist in understanding if chlorides are migrating through the <br/>soils. As well, additional soil sampling may be warranted next to pipes that are in a moderate to severe state of <br/>distress to understand chloride levels in those locations.</p>
<p>2014 soil samples indicated chloride levels were 1008 mg/L on 33 Avenue NW just west of 83 Street NW <br/>(Sample ID 2014-002). The 2024 electromagnetic inspection results show significantly distressed pipes between 17 m <br/>and 50 m from the sample, as shown in Figure 8-3 below.</p>

<p>Some locations indicated high soil resistivity and low chloride concentrations (2024FMSS-19), yet electromagnetic <br/>inspections indicated moderate distressed pipes within 10 m as shown in Figure 8-4.</p>

<p>In many areas, low resistivity soils and moderate chloride levels from both 2014 and 2024 soil samples were found <br/>adjacent to pipes showing moderate distress, similar to those shown in Figure 8-5.</p>

<p>Figure 8-6 shows that while 2024 FMSS-13 had moderate chlorides at 316 mg/L, just 15 m away, 2014-007 had <br/>negligible chlorides. Both of these samples were taken from areas off of the roadway in greenspace</p>

<p>Figure 8-7 illustrates that the 2014 soil sample (2014-009) shows chlorides at 239 mg/L. However, soil samples 22 m <br/>west (2024FMSS-06) and 15 m east (2024FMSS-07) on either side show chlorides at 1550 and 2270 mg/L, <br/>respectively. This is a significant difference. In addition to this, the pipes adjacent to these very corrosive chloride <br/>levels only show mild distress. It is possible that differences in groundwater movement along the feedermain may be a <br/>factor. Similar scenarios repeat themselves multiple times along the feedermain.</p>

<p>Figure 8-8 shows that the 2024 soil samples with both moderate and signiﬁcant chloride levels, and low resistivity, <br/>are adjacent to pipes with moderate distress.  <br/>Figure 8-8 Soil Samples and Wire Breaks on 16 Avenue &amp; Home Road NW</p>

<p>Phase 1 repair site of Pipe 20095 as shown in Figure 8-9, had soil samples with chloride levels ranging from 257 mg/L <br/>(moderate) to 3070 mg/L (extreme), while soil resistivity ranged from corrosive (460 ohm-cm) to not corrosive <br/>(2460 ohm-cm). Significant pipe distress was evident on the pipe exhumed from this location. <br/>Figure 8-9 Soil Samples and Wire Breaks on 16 Avenue &amp; 45 Street NW</p>

<p>Repaired Phase 1 pipes 20189, 20202, 20219 and 20220 in Figure 8-10 had soils with low resistivities (corrosive), as <br/>well as high to extreme levels of chlorides (as high as 8490 mg/L). There is no doubt based on this data that chlorides <br/>played a role in the distressed pipes that were exhumed from these locations. However, it is significant for The City to <br/>note that the 2014 soils samples (2014-011) indicated negligible levels (59.15 mg/L) of chlorides within 30 m of <br/>Pipes 20189 and 20202.</p>
<p>Figure 8-10 <br/>Soil Samples and Wire Breaks on 16 Avenue &amp; 42 Street NW</p>
<p>8.2 <br/>Geo-Environmental Assessment <br/>AE conducted a Geo-Environmental review along the feedermain which indicated a moderate to high potential for soil <br/>and groundwater contamination due to current or past activities. Refer to Appendix F. Specifically, road de-icing <br/>activities using sodium chloride is highly likely to have contributed to the elevated chloride concentrations found in <br/>the soil samples. While The City has confirmed that both sodium chloride (road salt) and liquid calcium chloride (brine) <br/>have been used as de-icers in the past, AE discovered a strong correlation between the elevated sodium and chloride <br/>concentrations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, AE’s Geo-Environmental review concluded that high concentrations of chlorides in greenspaces are not <br/>surprising. This is because chlorides from meltwater can migrate and accumulate in these areas, due to multiple factors <br/>including the presence of gravel soils common in the region.</p>

<h2>9 Metallurgical Analysis</h2>
<p>9 <br/>METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS <br/>Pure obtained samples of the prestress wire and steel cylinder of the ruptured and exhumed pipes for analysis. Their <br/>report is provided in Appendix G. In summary, the lab analysis revealed the following information: <br/>• <br/>The steel cylinder and wires met AWWA C301 requirements for strength at the time of manufacturing. <br/>• <br/>The prestress wires exhibited poor torsional ductility; however, this was not a requirement of AWWA <br/>standards at the time.  <br/>• <br/>Some of the wires sent for analysis had longitudinal splits, consistent with wires drawn at high temperatures <br/>resulting in Dynamic Strain Aging. <br/>• <br/>The 8-gauge wire used on Class 16 pipe had HE sensitivity. <br/>• <br/>The 6-gauge wire used on Class 20 pipe had no sensitivity to HE.</p>

<h2>10 Mortar and Concrete Analysis</h2>
<p>10 <br/>MORTAR AND CONCRETE ANALYSIS <br/>Tetra Tech was retained by Pure to conduct laboratory analysis of the mortar and concrete core samples obtained <br/>from the June 5, 2024 rupture. Tetra Tech’s report (in Appendix H) concluded that the mortar and concrete used in <br/>the Class 16 pipe, which ruptured, was of good to excellent quality and would have met C301 standards. There was no <br/>mortar deterioration or chemical attack, and the level of chlorides in the mortar and concrete were low, so they were <br/>not a contributing factor to the deterioration of the steel components.</p>
<p>AE’s subconsultant Thurber Engineering conducted an analysis of the mortar and concrete samples of the pipes which <br/>were exhumed in the Phase 1 repairs. Thurber’s analysis (in Appendix D) determined that 3 of the 4 pipes exhumed <br/>(Pure Robotic Pipe 20095, 20202, 20219) had chloride ions penetrate the mortar that exceeded American Concrete <br/>Institute thresholds.  <br/>• <br/>Pipe 20095 showed evidence of chloride penetration in the mortar samples where distress was noted, but not <br/>in areas where the pipe was in otherwise good shape. There was also no chloride penetration of the outer <br/>concrete core. <br/>• <br/>Pipe 20202 showed evidence of chloride penetration in the mortar samples where distress was noted, but not <br/>in areas where the pipe was in otherwise good shape. There was evidence of chloride penetration of the outer <br/>concrete core in some of the distressed areas. <br/>• <br/>Pipe 20219 showed evidence of chloride penetration in the mortar samples where distress was noted, and <br/>generally not where the pipe appeared sound. <br/>• <br/>Pipe 20220 had only one core taken, which did not show evidence of chloride penetration of the mortar or <br/>concrete.</p>
<p>It is important to note here that the fabrication drawings of the pipes routinely listed the use of Type V Sulphate <br/>resistant cement. While soils with high sulphates are more commonly found in Calgary than soils with high chloride <br/>levels, sulphate resistant cement is considered to be one of the least resistant mixes to chloride penetration.</p>

<h2>11 Live Load Assessment</h2>
<p>11 <br/>LIVE LOAD ASSESSMENT <br/>Visual examination of the exhumed pipes in the Phase 1 repairs did not reveal signs of visual cracking consistent with <br/>overloading or other stresses. While microcracking due to live loads cannot be ruled out on the ruptured and exhumed <br/>pipe, the distribution of distressed pipes within green space, medians, and residential roads is relatively similar to those <br/>under major roads. Therefore, live loading subsequent to construction is not believed to be a factor, however <br/>microcracking due to live loads during original construction activities such as backfill, remains a possibility.</p>
