2.1 
Description 
Construction of the 1950 mm and 1500 mm portions of the BSFM were completed in 1975. The portion of pipe that 
is the focus of this report is AWWA C-301 (ECP), commonly referred to as Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe (PCCP) 
Embedded Cylinder Type.  
The pipe was fabricated by Canron, which eventually became Hyprescon, then Hanson, then Forterra, and is now 
known as Rinker. This type of pipe contains a thin gauge steel cylinder embedded within a concrete core. The pipe is 
then laid horizontally and spun while prestressing wires are wound around it under stresses exceeding 150,000 psi. 
The wires are then coated in a mortar mix. It is primarily the prestress wire diameter (gauge) and spacing (pitch) that 
provide the internal pressure capacity of the pipe, while the steel cylinder acts primarily as a water barrier and not a 
structural element. See Figure 2-1 below.

Unique to this pipe is that the pressure classes, steel gauges, wire pitch, mortar and concrete core thickness, joints, 
and lay lengths are generally dictated by the manufacturer based on project design requirements, in accordance with 
AWWA design criteria. Pipe joints typically consist of bell and spigot made up of steel joint rings and rubber gaskets. 
These joints are then protected by mortar-based field coatings commonly referred to as diapers.  
 
Catastrophic failures of C301 pipe are not unusual given the nature of its design. While non-catastrophic leaks do 
occur at joints, non-catastrophic leaks in the barrel section are considered rare. Catastrophic failures typically occur in 
the barrel section. Across North America, the primary causes for the pipe to fail catastrophically in the barrel section 
include: 
• 
Hydrogen embrittlement of the prestress wires, due to either stray current or the use of prestress wire with 
hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity. 
• 
Sulphate attack of the mortar coating, allowing corrosion of the steel wires and cylinder to occur. 
• 
Chlorides penetrating the mortar/concrete and attacking the steel wires and cylinder. 
• 
Installation damage or poor-quality installation. 
• 
Third party damage after installation.

The C301 portion of the BSFM does not have impressed current cathodic protection and was not designed with 
electrically continuous joints.

Pressure Rating 
The 1950 mm portion of the BSFM conveys water from the Bearspaw WTP High Lift Pump Station (HLPS) at an 
elevation of 1083 m. Portions of the feedermain drop to as low as 1053 m based on the plan and profile record 
drawings. It is AE’s understanding that the maximum pump head at the HLPS is approximately 57 m (90 psi). Based on 
The City’s Feedermain Specifications, the conservative working pressure of the feedermain at the lowest point along 
the 1950 mm portion is then 869 kPa (126 psi). The design pressure (which considers a transient event) for the lowest 
portion of the feedermain would be 1310 kPa (190 psi) based on The City’s current standards, and 1145 kPa (166 psi) 
based on current AWWA C304 standard. The City’s current design pressure requirements exceed current 
AWWA C304 requirements which only require 40 psi surge pressure to be added to the working pressure. It is AE’s 
understanding that The City’s current standards for calculating pressure ratings were common practice at The City in 
the 1970’s. 
 
The Canron fabrication drawings in The City’s records are missing a key page showing key design data, and do not 
state the design pressure of the various pressure classes used along the pipe. Rinker indicated they do not have the 
manufacturing records or design calculations of the pipe and were therefore unable to confirm the pressure ratings of 
the pipe used on the project. Rinker referred AE to the AWWA C304 standard to determine each individual pipe 
segment’s pressure rating. It is noted that C304 did not exist at the time of pipe manufacture, as the sole standard of 
the day was C301.

The 1950 mm C301 portion of the BSFM is comprised of Canron Class 16 and Class 20 pipe segments. Past versions 
of the manufacturer’s catalogues list the pressure classes of C301 pipe at various diameters and state the standard 
working pressure ratings at various depths of cover via design charts. In general, these catalogues listed C301 Class 16 
pipe as 1103 kPa (160 psi) working pressure at 0 m cover, and Class 20 at 1379 kPa (200 psi) working pressure at 0 m 
cover for various pipe diameters. These pressure ratings decreased as the depth of cover increased. AE could not 
source a catalogue specifically showing the 1950 mm diameter of C301 (ECP). As well, Rinker did not want to make 
the assumption that the pipe used for the BSFM had the same ratings. 
 
The original pipe that ruptured was a Class 16 pipe. Located at Sta. 136+74 to 136+90 ft, its invert was at an elevation 
of approximately 1060 m. This equates to a working pressure of 800 kPa (116 psi), and a design pressure of 1200 kPa 
(174 psi) based on current City standards, and a design pressure of 1076 kPa (156 psi) per C304. The City’s record 
drawings provide evidence in numerous places that the Class 16 pipe was rated for a working pressure of at least 
150 psi. While unconfirmed at this diameter, as noted above, Canron Class 16 C301 pipe was typically rated for 
160 psi working pressure at 0 m cover.  
 
Given the information available, there is no indication that the pipe’s original pressure ratings were not appropriate, 
given the standards at the time. This is further supported by Performance Curves generated for The City by Pure, 
which are discussed later in this report. This assumes the various pipe classes were installed at the appropriate 
locations as per the lay sheets. There are no indications based on the exhumed pipe that the various pipe classes were 
installed at incorrect locations, however Pure’s electromagnetic scans indicate changes were made during pipe 
fabrication and installation that were not captured on the record drawings.

AWWA Standards 
There are currently three AWWA documents applicable to the design, manufacture, and installation of prestressed 
concrete cylinder pipe: 
• 
AWWA C301 Standard for Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe. 
• 
AWWA C304 Standard for Design of Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe. 
• 
AWWA M9 Design Manual for Concrete Pressure Pipe. 
 
At the time this pipe was manufactured in 1974, only the C301 standard was in existence, having been first introduced 
in 1949. AWWA C304 was not introduced until 1992, and the M9 manual was first introduced in 1979. This is an 
important distinction to make as key changes were made to the design of PCCP pipe after 1979 which will be 
discussed further in this report. 
 
The American Concrete Pressure Pipe Association (ACPPA) was established in 1949 (the same year as C301) and 
represents most North American PCCP manufacturers. The ACPPA generally references AWWA standards.
