STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS AND CONDITIONS
1.  STANDARD OF CARE
This Report has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted engineering or environmental consulting practices in the applicable jurisdiction.
No other warranty, expressed or implied, is intended or made.
2.  COMPLETE REPORT
All documents, records, data and files, whether electronic or otherwise, generated as part of this assignment are a part of the Report, which is of a
summary nature and is not intended to stand alone without reference to the instructions given to Thurber by the Client, communications between
Thurber and the Client, and any other reports, proposals or documents prepared by Thurber for the Client relative to the specific site described herein,
all of which together constitute the Report.
IN ORDER TO PROPERLY UNDERSTAND THE SUGGESTIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS AND OPINIONS EXPRESSED HEREIN, REFERENCE MUST BE
MADE TO THE WHOLE OF THE REPORT. THURBER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR USE BY ANY PARTY OF PORTIONS OF THE REPORT WITHOUT REFERENCE
TO THE WHOLE REPORT.
3.  BASIS OF REPORT
The Report has been prepared for the specific site, development, design objectives and purposes that were described to Thurber by the Client. The
applicability and reliability of any of the findings, recommendations, suggestions, or opinions expressed in the Report, subject to the limitations provided
herein, are only valid to the extent that the Report expressly addresses proposed development, design objectives and purposes, and then only to the
extent that there has been no material alteration to or variation from any of the said descriptions provided to Thurber, unless Thurber is specifically
requested by the Client to review and revise the Report in light of such alteration or variation.
4.  USE OF THE REPORT
The information and opinions expressed in the Report, or any document forming part of the Report, are for the sole benefit of the Client. NO OTHER
PARTY MAY USE OR RELY UPON THE REPORT OR ANY PORTION THEREOF WITHOUT THURBER’S WRITTEN CONSENT AND SUCH
USE SHALL BE ON SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS THURBER MAY EXPRESSLY APPROVE. Ownership in and copyright for the contents
of the Report belong to Thurber. Any use which a third party makes of the Report, is the sole responsibility of such third party. Thurber accepts no
responsibility whatsoever for damages suffered by any third party resulting from use of the Report without Thurber’s express written permission.
5. 
INTERPRETATION OF THE REPORT
a)
Nature and Exactness of Soil and Contaminant Description: Classification and identification of soils, rocks, geological units, contaminant materials
and quantities have been based on investigations performed in accordance with the standards set out in Paragraph 1. Classification and
identification of these factors are judgmental in nature. Comprehensive sampling and testing programs implemented with the appropriate
equipment by experienced personnel may fail to locate some conditions. All investigations utilizing the standards of Paragraph 1 will involve an
inherent risk that some conditions will not be detected and all documents or records summarizing such investigations will be based on
assumptions of what exists between the actual points sampled. Actual conditions may vary significantly between the points investigated and the
Client and all other persons making use of such documents or records with our express written consent should be aware of this risk and the
Report is delivered subject to the express condition that such risk is accepted by the Client and such other persons. Some conditions are subject
to change over time and those making use of the Report should be aware of this possibility and understand that the Report only presents the
conditions at the sampled points at the time of sampling. If special concerns exist, or the Client has special considerations or requirements, the
Client should disclose them so that additional or special investigations may be undertaken which would not otherwise be within the scope of
investigations made for the purposes of the Report.
b)
Reliance on Provided Information: The evaluation and conclusions contained in the Report have been prepared on the basis of conditions in
evidence at the time of site inspections and on the basis of information provided to Thurber. Thurber has relied in good faith upon representations,
information and instructions provided by the Client and others concerning the site. Accordingly, Thurber does not accept responsibility for any
deficiency, misstatement or inaccuracy contained in the Report as a result of misstatements, omissions, misrepresentations, or fraudulent acts
of the Client or other persons providing information relied on by Thurber. Thurber is entitled to rely on such representations, information and
instructions and is not required to carry out investigations to determine the truth or accuracy of such representations, information and instructions.
c)
Design Services: The Report may form part of design and construction documents for information purposes even though it may have been issued
prior to final design being completed. Thurber should be retained to review final design, project plans and related documents prior to construction
to confirm that they are consistent with the intent of the Report. Any differences that may exist between the Report’s recommendations and the
final design detailed in the contract documents should be reported to Thurber immediately so that Thurber can address potential conflicts.
d)
Construction Services: During construction Thurber should be retained to provide field reviews. Field reviews consist of performing sufficient and
timely observations of encountered conditions in order to confirm and document that the site conditions do not materially differ from those
interpreted conditions considered in the preparation of the report. Adequate field reviews are necessary for Thurber to provide letters of assurance,
in accordance with the requirements of many regulatory authorities.
6. 
RELEASE OF POLLUTANTS OR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES
Geotechnical engineering and environmental consulting projects often have the potential to encounter pollutants or hazardous substances and the
potential to cause the escape, release or dispersal of those substances. Thurber shall have no liability to the Client under any circumstances, for the
escape, release or dispersal of pollutants or hazardous substances, unless such pollutants or hazardous substances have been specifically and
accurately identified to Thurber by the Client prior to the commencement of Thurber’s professional services.
7. 
INDEPENDENT JUDGEMENTS OF CLIENT
The information, interpretations and conclusions in the Report are based on Thurber’s interpretation of conditions revealed through limited investigation
conducted within a defined scope of services. Thurber does not accept responsibility for independent conclusions, interpretations, interpolations and/or
decisions of the Client, or others who may come into possession of the Report, or any part thereof, which may be based on information contained in
the Report. This restriction of liability includes but is not limited to decisions made to develop, purchase or sell land.
