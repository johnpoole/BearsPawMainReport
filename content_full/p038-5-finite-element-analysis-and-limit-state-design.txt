FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS & LIMIT STATE DESIGN 
Pure was enlisted by The City to develop Performance Curves through Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to determine 
when a pipe will reach various limit states as defined by AWWA C304, based on internal pressure, depth of cover, and 
the number of wire breaks per pipe segment. The Performance Curves for the Class 16 pipe at two depths of cover 
are provided in Figures 5-1 and 5-2. At the time of writing this report, AE had not received Performance Curves for 
the Class 20 pipe.  
 
Pure’s Performance Curves for the Class 16 1950 mm pipe show that the normal working pressure and design 
pressure (accounting for potential transients/surge) are well within the yield strength and ultimate strength of the 
pipe. However, the Performance Curves show that Class 16 pipes could possibly experience microcracking of the 
external mortar due to mild transient events, especially in areas with deep cover (significant external loading) or if any 
prestress wires have already been compromised. Microcracks are very small cracks within the mortar that are invisible 
to the naked eye, and an indication that the pipe has experienced significant internal or external stresses.  
 
Microcracking has no immediate impact on the structural integrity of a pipe but compromises the ability of the mortar 
to protect the prestressed wires from moisture and interaction with the soil around the pipe. There is a possibility that 
surge pressures resulted in microcracking of some pipes due to operations over the last 50 years. While Performance 
Curves for Class 20 pipes and 1500 mm pipes have not been provided, it is possible that the working pressures and 
external loading in those areas, combined with transient events, resulted in microcracking of those pipes as well.  
 
AWWA C304, which requires pipes to be designed according to the limit states as shown in Pure’s Performance 
Curves, was introduced in 1992. AWWA C304 introduced a unified design procedure that replaced two procedures 
previously outlined in AWWA C301-84. Therefore, it is possible that the design of the pipe did not account for 
microcracking while still meeting applicable standards at that time.
