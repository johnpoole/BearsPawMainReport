SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS 
Upon review of all available data at the time of writing this report, the following key findings can be made: 
• 
Pump and system operations immediately before the failure, did not contribute to the failure. 
• 
There is no information to suggest that applicable standards at the time were not followed. However, since 
the time of manufacture design standards have evolved in relation to limit states such as microcracking, 
prestress wire parameters, and protection from corrosive soils. 
• 
Sulphate resistant mortar was used in the manufacture of the pipe, which while meeting standards at the time, 
has since been found to be less resistant to chloride penetration.  
• 
Microcracking of the mortar due to internal or external stresses may have occurred, allowing for accelerated 
corrosion in areas with corrosive soils.   
• 
Some exhumed pipes with distress showed visible mortar cracking and delamination, while other distressed 
pipes had firm sound mortar. There was no evidence of sulphate attack of the mortar on any pipes. 
• 
Prestress wires on the distressed pipes with cracked and/or delaminated mortar showed longitudinal splits, 
lateral/transverse fractures, oblique fractures, pitting and general corrosion. 
• 
Prestress wires on the distressed pipe with sound mortar showed pitting and lateral fractures, indicating the 
mortar was not passivating the steel.  
• 
There does not appear to be any clear differentiating characteristics of the distress in Class 16 versus Class 20 
pipes. 
• 
Some prestress wires that appear good and electrically continuous, are brittle and are ready to fail. Therefore, 
electromagnetic inspections are likely reporting conservative pipe condition.  
• 
Failed wires in the non-ruptured pipes did not show any necking or visible cup and cone fractures to indicate 
that the wires experienced stresses beyond their original tensile strength. The necking observed in the 
ruptured pipe is therefore believed to have occurred during the rupture. 
• 
Black corrosion by-product was evident on many lateral/transverse fractures indicating potential SCC as 
defined by The Association for Materials Performance and Protection (AMPP). 
• 
There was no evidence of corrosion of the steel cylinder on the non-ruptured pipes, but there was on the 
ruptured pipe. 
• 
The locations of the distressed pipes from the electromagnetic inspection show no geographical patterns 
corresponding with land, structural or surface features. They are located in greenspaces, medians, residential 
roads, major roads and under the Bow River suggesting that live loading is not a consideration. 
• 
Stray current pickup or discharge is not believed to be driving the corrosion of the prestress wires but could 
be a contributing factor to corrosion of the prestress wires on pipes where the mortar has failed. 
• 
Extreme chloride concentrations are present in the soils surrounding the non-ruptured distressed pipes 
exposed to date. Soil samples around the ruptured pipe are not considered to be reliable. 
• 
There appears to have been a dramatic shift in chloride concentrations between The City’s 2014 soil sampling 
data and the most recent 2024 sampling data. 
• 
Elevated soil chloride concentrations are believed to be related to road de-icing activities using sodium 
chloride. 
• 
There is a strong correlation between soils with low resistivities, high chloride concentrations, and pipes with 
broken prestress wires. 
• 
Lab analysis shows evidence of general wire corrosion, pitting corrosion, brittle fractures and wire splitting.

• 
There is evidence of Dynamic Strain Aging of some prestress wires due to longitudinal splitting.  
• 
The prestress wires used on the Class 16 pipe shows sensitivity to Hydrogen Induced Cracking (Hydrogen 
Embrittlement) as defined by AMPP. The prestress wires on the Class 20 pipe do not show any sensitivity to 
HE. 
• 
Mortar lab tests demonstrated chloride penetration has occurred on three of the four distressed pipes 
exhumed to date, but did not occur on the ruptured pipe. The chloride penetration occurred on both Class 16 
and Class 20 pipes, but not all. 
• 
On the failed pipe (Class 16) and pipe 20220 (Class 20), there is no clear evidence of if or how chlorides or 
moisture may have reached the prestress wires. 
• 
The degree of pitting and corrosion on pipes with otherwise sound mortar, such as pipe 20220, supports the 
potential for microcracking since chloride penetration was not found.
