REPORT OF FINDINGS:
LABORATORY TESTING AND EVALUATION OF
PRESTRESSING WIRE AND STEEL CYLINDER SPECIMENS
FROM 78-INCH BEARSPAW FEEDERMAIN IN CALGARY, ALBERTA
INTRODUCTION
The 78-inch Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe (PCCP) in Calgary, Alberta has been the subject of an
investigation by Pure Technologies (Pure).  According to Josh Greenberg, Condition Assessment
Engineer with Pure, a pipe segment in the Bearspaw Feedermain failed on June 5, 2024.
Pure subsequently extracted some of the
prestressing wires and a portion of the
steel cylinder from this pipe segment and
shipped these specimens to RJ Peterman
& Associates, Inc. (RJPA), Manhattan,
KS for testing and evaluation.  These
wires were received by RJPA on 6-21-
2024 and the package sent by Pure
contained eight (8) individual wire pieces
from the failure location in the pipe.  Six
of these wires contained one broken end
shipment.  The other two wires were
extracte
prior to
shipment.  Photos documenting the fractured surfaces of each broken wire are shown in Appendix A of
this report.  This appendix shows two different views of each fracture.
The surface condition of the as-received 8-gage prestressing wires generally contained light-moderate
corrosion with some small areas of pitting along the wire length.  However, Broken Wires 1 and 6
contained significant corrosion with heavy pitting and were not suitable for additional testing.  A
relatively clean specimen of the steel cylinder without a weld was also sent to RJPA from which one
tensile coupon was extracted.
The laboratory tests requested by Pure included:
Four wire hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity tests, in accordance with ASTM A1032-15
(Reapproved 2019)
Four wire torsion tests, in accordance with ASTM A938-18
Four wire tensile tests, in accordance ASTM A370-20
One cylinder tensile test in accordance with ASTM A370-20

In addition to the wires from the failed pipe segment, Pure also sent two additional sets of prestressing
wires and cylinder samples.  These sample sets were received on 7-3-2024 and were labeled by Pure as
PRN 20095 and PRN 20219.

According to Pure, PRN 20095 (Figure 2) was identified by internal electromagnetic scanning to have
an estimated 50 broken wire wraps.  As one of the distressed pipes with a higher number of broken
wire wraps, it was selected for further investigation and potential repair.  External electromagnetic

scanning estimated there were 121 broken wire wraps on this pipe.  This pipe segment contained 8-
gage prestressing wires.
PRN 20219 (Figure 3) was identified by internal electromagnetic scanning to have an estimated 60
broken wire wraps from internal electromagnetic scanning.  External scanning estimated there were
227 broken wire wraps.  This pipe segment contained larger, 6-gage prestressing wires.
The laboratory tests requested by Pure for the specimens from each additional pipe included:
Two wire hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity tests, in accordance with ASTM A1032-15
(Reapproved 2019)
Two wire torsion tests, in accordance with ASTM A938-18
Two wire tensile tests, in accordance ASTM A370-20
Two cylinder tensile tests, one of the base metal and one with the weld in the gage section of the
tensile specimen, in accordance with ASTM A370-20

DESIGN STANDARDS AT THE TIME OF MANUFACTURE
Since the City of Calgary Bearspaw Water Supply Pipeline plans provided by Pure were dated April
1974, the design would likely have conformed to ASTM A227-71.  According to the AWWA c301-72
specification, wire for circumferential reinforcement was required to conform to ASTM A227 except
wires with higher tensile strengths than those listed in A227 could be used if they met the other
requirements of A227.  ASTM A227-71 listed Class I and Class II options for both 8-gage (0.162-inch)
and 6-gage (0.192-inch) diameter wires.
8-gage Class I wire had a minimum tensile strength of 200,000 psi and a maximum tensile strength of
230,000 psi. Class II wire had a minimum tensile strength of 231,000 psi and a maximum tensile
strength of 261,000 psi.
6-gage Class I wire had a minimum tensile strength of 192,000 psi and a maximum tensile strength of
221,000 psi. Class II wire had a minimum tensile strength of 222,000 psi and a maximum tensile
strength of 251,000 psi.
AWWA c301-72 required steel for cylinders to meet the requirements of the ASTM A415
(Specification for Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Sheets, Commercial Quality), except that the maximum
carbon content may be 0.25 per cent and the minimum yield point shall be 27,000 psi.

WIRE TENSILE TEST METHOD RESULTS
Tensile properties of the wire specimens were determined according to procedures specified in ASTM
A370-20, Standard Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Testing of Steel Products .  A 16-inch
overall length, 10-inch gage length specimen was tested for determination of ultimate tensile strength
and reduction-in-area ductility of the wire.  Tensile test results are reported in Table 3, and a photo of
each failed specimen is shown in Figure 7 through Figure 14.

Tensile Results of 8-Gage Wires from the Failed Pipe
Tensile Specimen 1557 (from Good Wire 2) failed in a ductile cup-cone manner (Figure 8).  The
ultimate tensile strength of this specimen, calculated from the peak breaking load and wire cross-
sectional area, was 269.2 ksi.  This stress is greater than the maximum value listed for 8-gage Class II
wire in ASTM A227-71 and would make it a Class III wire according to ASTM A648-72.  Note, the

AWWA c301-64 specification allowed for wires with higher tensile strengths than those listed in A227
to be used if they met the other requirements of A227.  ASTM A648-72 (which was likely being
written when the subject pipe was manufactured) listed 8-gage Class III wire as having a minimum
tensile strength of 262 ksi, and 6-gage Class III wire as having a minimum tensile strength of 252 ksi.
The remaining three wires from the failed pipe segment had less ductile failures.  Specimen 1554
(from Good Wire 1) and Specimen 1560 (from Broken Wire 3) each contained a pre-existing
longitudinal split that prevented these specimens from achieving a full cup-cone failure.  The oxidized
surfaces of this split can be seen in Figure 7 (Good Wire 1) and Figure 9 (Broken Wire 3).
Specimen 1563 from Broken Wire 5 failed at a much lower stress of 235.6 ksi due to a pre-existing
transverse crack (Figure 10) and failed in a non-ductile manner.  The oxidized area due to a transverse
crack within the break location is clearly visible in Figure 10.  Because of the extensive corrosion of
this wire, it is unclear if the transverse crack was initiated by HE or by pitting.
There were no reduction-in-area (RA) ductility requirements specified in ASTM A227, and none were
provided in ASTM A648 until the 1984 revisions.  ASTM A648-84 required a minimum RA of 30%.
ASTM A648-18 requires a minimum RA of 35% for 6-gage wire and 30% for all larger diameters.
Tensile Specimen 1557 (Good Wire 2) had a RA of 39.5% and would meet contemporary ductility
standards for 6-gage wire (ASTM A648-18 no longer includes 8-gage wire).
Specimen 1554 (from Good Wire 1) and Specimen 1560 (from Broken Wire 3) each had lower RA
values of 21.0% due to the presence of the longitudinal split, while Specimen 1563 (from Broken Wire
5) had a RA of only 14.3% due to the pre-existing transverse crack.
Tensile Results of 8-Gage Wires from Pipe 20095
Both tensile tests of the 8-gage wires from Pipe 20095 failed in a ductile cup-cone manner (Figure 11
and Figure 12) with an average tensile strength of 275.2 ksi, indicating the wire was a Class III wire
according to ASTM A648-72.  Additionally, the average RA of 46.0% would meet contemporary
ductility requirements.
Tensile Results of 6-Gage Wires from Pipe 20219
Both tensile tests of the 6-gage wires from Pipe 20219 failed in a ductile cup-cone manner (Figure 13
and Figure 14) with an average tensile strength of 262.9 ksi, indicating the wire was a Class III wire
according to ASTM A648-72.  Additionally, the average RA of 39.6% would meet contemporary
ductility requirements.

TORSION TEST METHOD AND RESULTS
There never were torsion test requirements for prestressing wire in ASTM A227.  Additionally, none
were incorporated into ASTM A648 until the 1988 revisions, and this same revision eliminated 8-gage
wire.  However, the torsion test is an excellent method for identifying wire that has been drawn at
excessive temperatures subjecting it to the effects of dynamic strain aging (DSA).
Torsion tests are performed by RJPA according to the contemporary test method specified in ASTM
A938-18, Standard Method for Torsion Testing of Wire.  In addition to the basic requirements in the
standard, RJPA conducts the torsion test on a modified machine lathe incorporating a data acquisition
system for continuous recording of revolutions and torque.
As allowed in Section 6.3 (End Preparation) of ASTM A938-18, the ends of the torsion specimen are
bent approximately 90° to the axis of the test specimen to prevent the gripped ends from slipping
during the test.
Torsion test results are listed in Table 4 and the torque-versus-rotation graphs for these same tests are
plotted in Figure 19 (wires from the failed pipe segment) and Figure 24 (wires from two additional
segments).  Photos documenting the torsion failures of the 8-gage wires from the failed pipe segment
are shown in Figure 15 through Figure 18.  Photos documenting the torsion failures of the 8-gage wires
from Pipe 20095 are shown in Figure 20 and Figure 21.  Photos documenting the torsion failures of the
6-gage wires from Pipe 20219 are shown in Figure 22 and Figure 23.
Torsion Results of 8-Gage Wires from Failed Pipe
From Table 4, all four wires from the failed pipe segment had poor torsional performance, failing in a
splitty manner between 0.49 and 7.97 revolutions.  Therefore, this wire would not meet the current 10-
revolution torsional requirement without any splitting failures for ASTM A648 6-gage wire, and the
torsion test confirms that the wire was likely subjected to DSA at the time of manufacture.
From Table 4, the maximum torque for Specimen 1556 (Good Wire 2) is significantly higher than the
maximum torque for the other three wires from the failed pipe segment.  The reason for this is because
the other three wires had pre-existing longitudinal splits prior to testing, as evidenced by the oxidized
surface of the split that became evident while testing (refer to Figure 15, Figure 17 and Figure 18), but
Specimen 1556 did not contain a pre-existing split.  Instead, Specimen 1556 split during the torsion
test, after approximately 0.7 revolutions.  This longitudinal splitting is further evidence of excessive
heating of the wire during the manufacturing process, which can result in excessive residual tensile
stresses upon cooling.

Torsion Results of 8-Gage Wires from Pipe 20095
From Table 4, both wires from Pipe 20095 withstood more than 11 revolutions prior to failure.
However, from Figure 20 and Figure 21, each of these wires had a pre-existing longitudinal split that
opened during the torsion test.  Therefore, these wires would not meet the current 10-revolution
torsional requirement without any splitting failures for ASTM A648 6-gage wire, and the torsion test
confirms that the wire was likely subjected to DSA at the time of manufacture.
Torsion Results of 6-Gage Wires from Pipe 20219
From Table 4 and Figure 24, both wires split at approximately 0.7 revolutions, and then kept rotating
prior to failing after more than 7 revolutions.  Therefore, these wires would not meet the current 10-
revolution torsional requirement without any splitting failures for ASTM A648 6-gage wire, and the
torsion test confirms that the wire was likely subjected to DSA at the time of manufacture.

HYDROGEN EMBRITTLEMENT (HE) SENSITIVITY TEST METHOD AND RESULTS
The European Federation Internationale de la Precontrainte (FIP) developed a laboratory test during
the late 1960's and early 1970's for evaluation of the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) sensitivity of PCCP
prestressing wire. A recommended procedure for performing the test was published by the organization
in 1980 that is most often referred to as the FIP ammonium thiocyanate test. Lewis Engineering and
Consulting, Inc. (LEC) constructed a dedicated test system in 1990 for performing the FIP test in
accordance with the recommended procedure in support of forensic investigations of PCCP failures.
Based upon test data acquired by LEC between 1990 and 2002 on prestressing wire manufactured
between the mid-1950's to 2002, a presentation was made by LEC to the ASTM A01.05 Wire Products
Task Group subcommittee proposing the development of an ASTM standard for the test.  The result
was the ASTM A1032-04 test procedure published by ASTM in September 2004, Standard Test
Method for Hydrogen Embrittlement Resistance for Steel Wire Hard Drawn Used for Prestressing
Concrete Pipe. Supplementary Requirements were added concurrently to ASTM A648-04a addressing
the use of A1032-04 in purchase order specifications for contemporary pipe wrap wire. RJPA
purchased the HE tests system from LEC in November 2019 and now conducts HE tests in accordance
with the latest revision of the standard, A1032-15 (Reapproved 2019).
A 16-inch-long Specimen of hand-straightened wire is prepared for the HE test. The wire straightened
specimens are fitted and sealed into a Pyrex T-shaped test cell that will be filled with a 20 percent (by
weight) ammonium thiocyanate solution. The wire specimens are loaded in tension at a force
equivalent to 70% of the specified minimum tensile strength. A resistance heating coil wrapped around
the outside of the test cell and connected to a proportioning temperature controller is employed to heat
the solution within the cell to 50 C and maintain that temperature for the duration of the test. A switch
activated relay stops the timer upon failure and records the time-to-failure (TTF) to the nearest 0.01
hours. Test Specimens are removed at failure, or after 100 hours if no failure occurs.
Based upon the extensive experience with the HE sensitivity test method by Richard Lewis at LEC,
wire that exhibits practically no HE sensitivity will consistently survive the test for 75 hours or more.
An increasing degree of HE sensitivity is indicated by failure times progressively less than 75 hours. A
slight-to-moderate HE sensitivity is indicated by a time-to-failure (TTF) of approximately 50 hours,
and a significant HE sensitivity is indicated for TTF less than 20 hours.

Since the tensile test results indicated both the 8-gage and 6-gage wires in this investigation were Class
III wire according to ASTM A648-72, the 8-gage specimens were loaded to a tension equal to 70% of
the ASTM A648-72 Class III specified minimum tensile strength (0.7 x
x 262,000 psi =
3,781 pounds).  Similarly, the 6-gage specimens were loaded to a tension equal to 70% of the ASTM
A648-72 Class III specified minimum tensile strength (0.7 x
x 252,000 psi = 5,110
pounds).  The time-to-failure (TTF) recorded for each of the wire specimens supplied by Pure are
shown in Table 5.

HE Results of 8-Gage Wires from Failed Pipe
The time-to-failure (TTF) recorded for the four 8-gage wire specimens from the failed pipe ranged
from 3.27 hours to 50.94 hours, with an average of 16.16 hours.  Moreover, three of the four specimens
had a TTF less than 7 hours.  This indicates that the wire from the failed pipe segment has a significant
HE sensitivity, which is consistent with the poor torsional performance.  The HE fractures of all four
specimens from the failed pipe included longitudinal splitting of the wire.
HE Results of 8-Gage Wires from Pipe 20095
The time-to-failure (TTF) recorded for the two 8-gage wire specimens from the Pipe 20095 were 2.87
hours and 4.15 hours, averaging 3.51 hours.  This indicates that the wire has a significant HE
sensitivity, which is also consistent with the poor torsional performance.  The fractures of both
specimens from Pipe 20095 included longitudinal splitting of the wire.
HE Results of 6-Gage Wires from Pipe 20219
The two 6-gage wire specimens from the Pipe 20219 withstood more than 116 hours of HE exposure
testing without failing.  This surpasses the current 75-hour TTF requirement of ASTM A648-18 and
indicates that these wires have practically no HE sensitivity.

STEEL CYLINDER TENSILE TEST RESULTS
The relatively clean specimens of 16-gage steel cylinder provided by Pure were suitable for
mechanical property testing.  Both surfaces of the each cylinder specimen were dark gray in color with
areas of residual cementitious deposits and light rusting.  The cylinder specimen from the failed pipe
segment provided by Pure did not contain a weld, so a single specimen of this base metal was prepared
for testing.  The cylinder specimens from Pipe 20095 and Pipe 20219 each contained a weld and were
selected for the preparation of two tensile specimens, one of the base metal and one containing the
weld within the machined gage length of the test specimen.
Cylinder tensile test specimens were prepared in a dog-bone configuration compliant with the
requirements and specifications for testing of steel product in ASTM A370.  The results of the tensile
tests for the base metal and with-weld test specimens are shown in Table 6.

Cylinder Plate Results from Failed Pipe
The base metal specimen had an ultimate tensile strength of 55.12 ksi and a yield strength of 45.94 ksi.
Furthermore, AWWA C301-64 required the minimum yield strength of the steel cylinder to be at least
27,000 psi, and the steel cylinder from the failed pipe met this requirement.  Figure 33 shows the
mating tensile fractures of the steel cylinder specimen from the failed pipe.

Cylinder Plate Results from Pipe 20095
The base metal specimen from Pipe 20095 had an ultimate tensile strength of 61.97 ksi and a yield
strength of 53.77 ksi.  The ratio of yield strength to tensile strength (87%) is consistent with the
requirements for hot-rolled steel, and the yield strength met the 27,000 psi minimum requirement of
AWWA C301-64.
The tensile strength of the specimen containing the weld was 52.93 ksi and the yield strength was
39.13 ksi.  The 14.6% reductions in tensile strength (from 61.97 ksi to 52.93 ksi) and 27.2% reduction
in yield strength (from 53.77 ksi to 39.13 ksi) for the section containing the weld are both higher than
expected for properly welded hot-rolled sections and may be indicative of excessive heat during the
welding process.  Still, the post-weld yield strength is well above the 27,000 psi minimum requirement
of AWWA C301-64 and indicative that a sufficient weld was achieved.  Figure 34 shows the mating
tensile fractures of the base specimen.  The mating tensile fractures of the specimen containing the
weld are shown in Figure 35.
Cylinder Plate Results from Pipe 20219
The base metal specimen from Pipe 20219 had an ultimate tensile strength of 57.62 ksi and a yield
strength of 49.34 ksi.  The ratio of yield strength to tensile strength (86%) is consistent with the
requirements for hot-rolled steel, and the yield strength met the 27,000 psi minimum requirement of
AWWA C301-64.
The tensile strength of the specimen containing the weld was 60.35 ksi and the yield strength was
37.73 ksi.  In this case, the section containing the weld had a slightly higher ultimate tensile strength.
The reason for this is unknown.  The post-weld yield strength of 37.73 ksi is well above the 27,000 psi
minimum requirement of AWWA C301-64 and indicative that a sufficient weld was achieved.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Failed Pipe
The tensile strength of the two 8-gage prestressing wires that were labeled
271.0 ksi,
making the wire a Class III wire according to ASTM A648-72.  Two of the
-existing longitudinal split that became evident after
tensile failure.
Wires from the broken pipe also had very poor torsional ductility.  Three of the torsion specimens had
a pre-existing longitudinal split and a fourth torsion specimen developed a longitudinal split with less
than one full revolution.  This indicates that the wire was likely drawn at a high temperature resulting
in dynamic strain aging (DSA).  The prevalence of longitudinal splitting is also consistent with high
drawing temperatures.
HE exposure testing of four wires from this same pipe revealed that the wire had a significant HE
sensitivity, with an average TTF of 16.16 hours.  Furthermore, three of the four wires had a TTF of
less than 7 hours.
A tensile test of the steel cylinder indicated that the steel still meets the minimum yield strength
requirement that was in place at the time of manufacture.
Therefore, the 8-gage wire samples provided by Pure from the failed pipe segment are in overall poor
condition, and it is likely that hydrogen embrittlement of the prestressing wires contributed to the
failure of the pipe.
Pipe 20095
The tensile strength of the two 8-gage prestressing wires from Pipe 20095 averaged 275.2 ksi, making
the wire a Class III wire according to ASTM A648-72.  The two wires also had excellent ductility with
a RA averaging 46.0%.
Wires from Pipe 20095 had very poor torsional ductility.  The two torsion specimens had a pre-
existing longitudinal split but were still able to rotate more than 11 revolutions prior to failing in shear.
This presence of the pre-existing longitudinal split indicates that the wire was likely drawn at a high
temperature resulting in dynamic strain aging (DSA).
HE exposure testing of two wires from this same pipe revealed that the wire had a significant HE
sensitivity, with an average TTF of 3.51 hours.

Two tensile tests of the steel cylinder (one with and one without a weld in the gage length) indicated
that the cylinder met the minimum tensile requirement at the time of manufacture and that a sufficient
weld was achieved.
Pipe 20219
The tensile strength of the two 6-gage prestressing wires from Pipe 20219 averaged 262.9 ksi, making
the wire a Class III wire according to ASTM A648-72.  The two wires also had excellent ductility with
an RA averaging 39.6 (which would meet contemporary standards for 6-gage Class III wire).
Wires from the Pipe 20219 had very poor torsional ductility.  Both torsion specimens developed a
longitudinal split at less than one revolution, with one specimen failing in a splitty manner and the
other failing primarily in shear.  Both specimens exceeded 7 revolutions before failure.  This
longitudinal splitting indicates that the wire was likely drawn at a high temperature resulting in
dynamic strain aging (DSA).
Two wires from this same pipe did not split or fail after more than 116 hours of HE exposure testing.
These excellent HE test results are remarkable, especially since the wire had poor torsional
performance as exhibited by longitudinal splitting of the wire at less than one revolution during the
torsion test.  The reason for this apparent inconsistency is unknown.
Two tensile tests of the steel cylinder (one with and one without a weld in the gage length) indicated
that the cylinder met the minimum tensile requirement at the time of manufacture and that a sufficient
weld was achieved.
