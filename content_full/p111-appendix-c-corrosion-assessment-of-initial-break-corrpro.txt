INTRODUCTION 
On June 7, 2024, Corrpro Canada, Inc. (Corrpro) was contracted by Associate Engineering to perform a corrosion 
assessment on a water main break for the City of Calgary, located in the Montgomery neighborhood south of the Safeway 
on 16 Avenue NW. The water main is a large diameter C 301 pipe which has a thin metal wall encased in concrete which 
is reinforced by high-tension steel cables wrapped around the circumference of the pipe. Corrpro personnel Jeff Burton 
P.Eng., AMPP CP2, performed an additional investigation on June 21, 2024. This report is an addendum to the previous 
Corrpro report dated June 11, 2024. 
SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS 
June 21, 2024 
The damaged pipe is a 1950 mm C 301, prestressed concrete pressure pipe, steel cylinder type. Three sections of the pipe 
have been removed. The ends still in the ground on either side were tested for their AC and DC potentials. The amperage 
was taken by connecting both ends of the still underground pipe segments. Resistance was measured at the west 
upstream point of site A, and on the isolated pipe between site C and site D at the open site D end. 
Pipe-to-soil DC potential was less negative than -302 mVCSE on all test sites, which is consistent for a steel structure with 
no cathodic protection (CP) applied. The DC potential measured is below the -1000 mVCSE threshold of causing hydrogen 
embrittlement, laid out by Sylvia Hall in 1998 form NACE paper 637, and therefore that risk is still deemed a non-issue. All 
current connections tested were below 0.02 mV, which is very low, indicating no significant levels of stray current. The 
pipe-to-soil resistance at site A was 28,000 Ω, indicating that section of pipe is unlikely to have any corrosive areas of any 
significance. A pipe-to-soil resistance of 7 Ω measured on the segment between site C and site D indicate there may be 
some small areas of corrosion on that segment. Test data can be found in ‘Table 1’ below.

There is a general trend of the DC potential being higher on the west side of the pipeline. This can also be attributed to 
coincidental changes in soil conditions at the point of measurements. There was very little amperage measured between 
sections, indicating no stray current in the area. We cannot rule out stray current pickup or discharge in the damaged and 
removed sections of the pipe. 
The highest AC potential measured between all sites was 153 mA, measured on the east side of site D. This amount of AC 
voltage in the pipe is of no concern for corrosion, and additionally shows no AC interference within the pipes from the 
downstream power lines, or any other source of AC. Additionally, the difference in potential of the in-ground pipe 
segments of 210 mV from W -> E across site A, and 80 mV W -> E on site D, are not high enough to be of any concern. No 
difference was taken across site C.  
Soil resistivity was not taken at each of the sites. Sites previously tested in the area were found to have mild to highly 
corrosive soil, and high chloride contents. The soil at each excavation was visibly similar for the area (6” river rock mix). 
At site C, rust and corrosion was found on the concrete just below the tension cables as the top layer of concrete easily 
broke away from the tension cables. This is an indicator that this area has been corroding before the break. Areas like 
these exposed to the external environment can act as a localized corrosion points as well as discharge point for stray 
current corrosion. 
City of Calgary facility maps were provided for the immediate area of the break. Facility maps do not show any major 
below grade steel structures, which would be necessary for stray current pickup or discharge. This does not mean that 
stray current pickup or discharge cannot occur, as there may be unmapped steel structures underground.  
Chloride Discussion 
Corrpro has done a literature review on the effect of chlorides on PCCP pipes. A more detailed report will follow.
