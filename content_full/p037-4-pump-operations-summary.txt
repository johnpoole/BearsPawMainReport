PUMP OPERATIONS SUMMARY 
AE conducted a pump operations review immediately following the rupture of the BSFM; the technical memorandum 
is included in Appendix A. This review included an examination of pump operations prior to the failure, as well as a 
hydraulic analysis of the BSFM during a simulated transient pressure event. According to this review, pump operations 
immediately before the failure did not contribute to the failure. The modeled pressures during the simulated transient 
event were within bounds and not a contributing factor.
