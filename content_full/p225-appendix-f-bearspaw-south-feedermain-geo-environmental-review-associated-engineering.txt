Location:
Plan 8011474, Block 1, Lot 1-27
Disposition:
Imperial Oil Limited owned and operated a petroleum refinery and petroleum storage tank farm (Tank Farm).
Imperial Oil Limited became the registered owner of the Tank Farm Lands, which they sold to Devon Estates
Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil Limited. The tank farm was comprised of six large aboveground
petroleum storage tanks, which contained unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel. While the refinery was in production,
four of the storage tanks were located in the area where the townhouse units presently exist. Devon Estates
Limited entered into a joint venture agreement to develop the Lynnview Ridge Subdivision. The refinery and the
Tank Farm were decommissioned. There was an agreement to remove and dispose of the contaminated soil, and
to filling and compacting the affected areas in accordance with various recommendations of environmental
consultants. There were numerous high hydrocarbon vapour concentrations confirmed near shallow soils in the
former Tank Farm, which had been developed as the townhouse units. Alberta Environment representatives met
with representatives of the Parties to discuss the release of the Substances and the resulting adverse effects to the
Subdivision. Alberta Environment requested certain interim and long-term actions to be implemented. The full
extent of the release of the Substances and the resulting adverse effect to the surface and sub-surface soils, and to
the surface water and groundwater of the Subdivision Lands has not been fully delineated, nor is the extent of any
adverse effects beyond the boundaries of the Subdivision Lands. The parties shall submit an interim report, which
will include a complete delineation of the quantity, extent, levels and locations of the Substances in the surface and
sub-surface soils, and in the surface and groundwater, the immediate short-term measures that will be takes to
address any imminent risks of exposure by the residents and their households to the Substances, and a
communication and consultation plan by which the Lynnview Ridge Residents will be informed and/or consulted.
The parties shall submit a report containing all options to remediate the Substances and the adverse effects to the
Subdivision Land, and they shall implement that work. The Parties shall submit written status reports to the
Manager, along with a final report when the remedial work is completed. Appeal filed 3 July 2001.

Manitoba and the Territories was not captured. However, NEES is also a repository for previous Environment Canada spill datasets.  NEES is
composed of the historic datasets ' or Trends ' which dates from approximately 1974 to present. NEES Trends is a compilation of historic databases,
which were merged and includes data from NATES (National Analysis of Trends in Emergencies System), ARTS (Atlantic Regional Trends System),
and NEES.  In 2001, the Emergencies Program determined that variations in reporting regimes and requirements between federal and provincial
agencies made national spill reporting and trend analysis difficult to achieve. As a consequence, the department has focused efforts on capturing data
on spills of substances which fall under its legislative authority only (CEPA and FA). As such, the NEES database will be decommissioned in December
2004.

Database Descriptions: This section provides a detailed explanation for each database including: source, information available, time coverage, and
acronyms used. They are listed in alphabetic order.
Detail Report: This is the section of the report which provides the most detail for each individual record. Records are summarized by location, starting
with the project property followed by records in closest proximity.
Distance: The distance value is the distance between plotted points, not necessarily the distance between the sites' boundaries. All values are an
approximation.
Direction:  The direction value is the compass direction of the site in respect to the project property and/or center point of the report.
Elevation: The elevation value is taken from the location at which the records for the site address have been plotted. All values are an approximation.
Source: Google Elevation API.
Executive Summary: This portion of the report is divided into 3 sections:
'Report Summary'- Displays a chart indicating how many records fall on the project property and, within the report search radii.
'Site Report Summary'-Project Property'- This section lists all the records which fall on the project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report'
section.
'Site Report Summary-Surrounding Properties'- This section summarizes all records on adjacent properties, listing them in order of proximity from the
project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report' section.
Map Key: The map key number is assigned according to closest proximity from the project property. Map Key numbers always start at #1. The project
property will always have a map key of '1' if records are available. If there is a number in brackets beside the main number, this will indicate the number
of records on that specific property. If there is no number in brackets, there is only one record for that property.
The symbol and colour used indicates 'elevation': the red inverted triangle will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Lower Elevation', the yellow triangle will dictate
'ERIS Sites with Higher Elevation' and the orange square will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Same Elevation.'
Unplottables: These are records that could not be mapped due to various reasons, including limited geographic information. These records may or
may not be in your study area, and are included as reference.
