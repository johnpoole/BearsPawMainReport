PROBABLE CAUSE
Based on the information available to AE to date, the following conclusions can be made as to the probable cause of
the distress in the exhumed and ruptured pipe:

•
The June 5, 2024 rupture was caused by the loss of structural integrity of the pipe, primarily through the
failure of the prestress wires.
•
Since the ruptured pipe showed no evidence of chloride penetration within the mortar, it is believed that
microcracking or previous mortar damage allowed moisture and corrosive soils to interact with the
prestress wires, leading to Stress Corrosion Cracking or Hydrogen Embrittlement of the prestress wires
resulting in brittle wire failures.
•
It is difficult to distinguish between SCC and HE, however, both can occur on the same prestress wire. HE
is considered a form of SCC, but SCC is not considered a form of HE.
•
It is not possible to say with certainty at this point how passivation properties of the mortar coating on
the prestress wires were compromised.
•
Where mortar had already failed due to wire distress or other damage, the possibility for stray currents to
contribute to HE cannot be ruled out.
•
Since Class 20 pipe was not susceptible to HE, then SCC may be playing the largest role in causing the distress
on those pipes along the feedermain. The SCC would be due to the combination of tensile stress on wires
exposed to a corrosive environment via microcracking and/or chloride penetration of the mortar.
•
Dynamic Strain Aging is likely to have contributed to SCC on some wires due to crevice corrosion on pipes
where chlorides have penetrated the mortar and/or where microcracking has occurred.
•
Chloride induced corrosion and resulting pitting are also likely to have contributed to the SCC of wires on
some pipes.
•
In the pipes where HE is believed to have occurred, it is believed that pitting corrosion from chloride ingress
(through microcracks or mortar penetration) produced hydrogen, leading to HE and ultimately brittle failures
of the wires. HE is most likely to have occurred on the brittle failures where no evidence of corrosion product
is visible on the fracture surface itself.
•
Microcracking of the mortar over the years may have contributed to prestress wire corrosion.  The design of
C301 pipe is complex, and design standards of AWWA C301 have evolved over time. The design of the pipe
in the 1970’s, while acceptable at the time, may not have been sufficient to prevent microcracking, leading to
accelerated corrosion from aggressive environmental conditions over the entire life of the pipe.
•
High concentrations of chlorides in the soil are not always required to cause pipe distress if there is a
fluctuating water table, as fluctuating water tables can deposit chlorides on to the mortar leading to higher
concentrations on the mortar itself. Ground water monitoring has commenced to help with this assessment.
Additional soil sampling may be warranted next to pipes that are in a moderate to severe state of distress, to
assist in validating probable cause.

•
The dramatic shift in soil chemistry between 2014 and 2024 samples requires further investigation to develop
an opinion as to potential causes. In addition to ground water monitoring and additional soil sampling, a review
of distribution pipe failure rates in the Bowness/Montgomery area may be helpful. If chloride levels in the soil
have either increased or become widespread, the corrosion and break rates of other metallic pipe in the area
would also be expected to follow suit. Further to this, it would be prudent for The City to resample the soil in
areas along all feedermains where chloride levels were previously found to be greater than 100 mg/L,
particularly in areas along or adjacent to major roadways (Priority 1 snow removal routes). As a result, The City
may wish to revisit the risk profile of mortar coated steel, C301 and C303 along pipes with greater than
100 mg/L chlorides.
•
Spalling mortar appears to be attributed to either:
•
Brittle wire failures relieving tension and cracking the mortar leading to corrosion and further cracking.
•
Microcracking due to extreme internal or external stresses, leading to corrosion and visible cracking.
•
Based on the information available to date, it is most likely that the majority of the pipe distress along the
BSFM is due to SCC and HE. However, it is difficult to draw the conclusion that all the distressed pipes
reported by Pure along the entire feedermain have prestress wires failing due to a combination of HE or SCC
without further soil sampling, pipe exposure, and lab analysis of mortar and steel components.
