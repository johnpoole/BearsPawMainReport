METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS
Pure obtained samples of the prestress wire and steel cylinder of the ruptured and exhumed pipes for analysis. Their
report is provided in Appendix G. In summary, the lab analysis revealed the following information:
•
The steel cylinder and wires met AWWA C301 requirements for strength at the time of manufacturing.
•
The prestress wires exhibited poor torsional ductility; however, this was not a requirement of AWWA
standards at the time.
•
Some of the wires sent for analysis had longitudinal splits, consistent with wires drawn at high temperatures
resulting in Dynamic Strain Aging.
•
The 8-gauge wire used on Class 16 pipe had HE sensitivity.
•
The 6-gauge wire used on Class 20 pipe had no sensitivity to HE.
