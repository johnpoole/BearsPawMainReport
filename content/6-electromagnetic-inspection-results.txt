ELECTROMAGNETIC INSPECTION RESULTS
Following the June 5 rupture, The City contracted Pure to inspect the C301 portion of the BSFM west of the
Shaganappi Pump Station, using robotic and free-swimming electromagnetic inspection tools that employ remote field
eddy current transducer coupling technology (RFEC/TC). These inspections revealed a total of 239 distressed pipes in
addition to the pipe that ruptured. See Appendix B and Table 6-1. Distressed pipes are considered to be pipe lengths
having one or more wraps of prestressed wires that have broken, with each failed wrap commonly referred to as a
wire break. This translates to approximately 12.5% of the 9.6 km of inspected pipe being in some form of distress. The
locations of these pipes are mapped in Figure 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 and 6-4 and will be discussed in greater detail in the
following sections. The wire breaks on these figures are colour coded to align with The City’s pre-existing wire break
thresholds informed by Pure’s Performance Curves in Figures 5-1 and 5-2.
