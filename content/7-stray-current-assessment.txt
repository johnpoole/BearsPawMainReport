STRAY CURRENT ASSESSMENT
Corrpro was retained by AE to conduct tests for stray current and the presence of cathodic protection on the pipeline
at the initial rupture location, as well as the subsequent Phase 1 repair sites. Their report is included in Appendix C
with key findings as follows:
•
Corrpro conducted pipe to soil DC potential measurements that confirmed no cathodic protection exists on
the pipeline as per City records.
•
The DC potential was -302 mV, less than the -1000 mV industry threshold of causing hydrogen
embrittlement.
•
No significant levels of stray current were found.
•
Low AC potential indicate unlikely AC influence being a factor.
•
Corrpro noted that while the voltage potential itself would not likely be a concern, damaged mortar coating
could be a contributing factor to steel corrosion, and stray current pickup or discharge in those areas cannot
be ruled out.
